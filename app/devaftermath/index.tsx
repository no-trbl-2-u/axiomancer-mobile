/**
 * Dev-only aftermath-panel showcase (visual-audit 2026-06). Renders the
 * combat aftermath panels that have no organic capture path — DEFEAT
 * (the player can't lose to the tutorial rat deterministically) and
 * PARLEY (mercy is a branch combat-drive doesn't take) — with fixed
 * sample view-models so the panel internals can be eyeballed without
 * driving combat to those outcomes. Victory is already captured via the
 * real combat flow (screen 11), so it's omitted here.
 *
 * One panel per render, chosen by the `panel` query param
 * (`/devaftermath?panel=defeat|parley`, default defeat), so each capture
 * is a true 390×844 frame — the panels are full-screen seal bodies in
 * the real flow. Pure presentational: each panel takes a hand-built VM +
 * no-op handlers. No store, no engine. Gated to dev builds; production
 * renders nothing. Mirrors the `/devart` enemy-art gallery.
 *
 * Route: /devaftermath
