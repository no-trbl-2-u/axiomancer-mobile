/**
 * Dev-only auto-seed on first boot (via /jot 39695a5).
 *
 * User-jot: "the starting character to have a bunch of items
 * to test the equipment and consumable mechanics." A blank
 * inventory is the wrong default for DEV builds since manual
 * testing depends on having items + skills + a seeded map.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - Production (`__DEV__` false): renders null, no effect.
 *   - DEV with empty player.inventory: fires `actions.debugSeed()`
 *     once on mount; persistence saves the seeded state, so
 *     subsequent launches see a non-empty inventory and skip
 *     the auto-seed.
 *   - DEV with non-empty player.inventory: no-op; the player's
 *     prior session state stands.
 *
 * Renders null — it's a side-effect-only component.
