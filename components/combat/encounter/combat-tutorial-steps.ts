/**
 * Hazard-pattern combat — guided first-fight coach script (mobile UI layer).
 *
 * Pure data + predicates, exactly like the gathering tutorial: each step names
 * what the coach says and the condition (over the live encounter state +
 * view-model) that advances it. The coach derives the current step every render
 * as the FIRST step whose predicate is unmet — stateless progression, so a
 * player who runs ahead of the script simply skips the steps they already
 * proved.
 *
 * Every predicate is written against a MONOTONIC signal — one that latches true
 * and never goes back to false (cumulative pressure, discard count, turn/phase
 * counters). This matters because per-turn state like the drafted die resets on
 * NEW TURN; if a predicate read that directly, the script could snap backwards.
 * The monotonic backstops (`discard`, `turn`, `currentPhaseIndex`) also keep the
 * script honest for a player who blitzes ahead before the coach catches up.
 *
 * These cover TURN ONE only (draft → spend → read the tracks → advance); the
 * script completes itself the moment the player takes a second turn or resolves
 * the phase.
