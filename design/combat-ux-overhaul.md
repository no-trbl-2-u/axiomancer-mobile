# Combat UX Legibility Overhaul — Design Brief

> **Design-first phase output.** This document addresses AUDIT [4.5] Combat UX unintuitive and playtest findings [F02-F06] through systematic design improvements. Implementation follows in subsequent phases.

## Executive Summary

### Problems Identified
Current combat UI suffers from comprehension barriers identified in user testing:
- **[F02] Encounter jargon unclear:** Technical terms confuse players 
- **[F04] Battle log ability names confusing:** Engine terminology doesn't match player expectations
- **[F05] LET phase numbers meaningless:** Round progression lacks clear meaning
- **[F06] CRUCIBLE symbols incomprehensible:** Icons require mental translation

### Design Solution Approach
Transform combat from "decode the interface" to "understand the tactical situation" through:
1. **Player-centric terminology** replacing engine jargon
2. **Intuitive iconography** that communicates meaning at a glance
3. **Clear information hierarchy** emphasizing decision-relevant data
4. **Progressive disclosure** of complex mechanics

## 1. Terminology Clarification

### Core Combat Vocabulary

| **Current Engine Term** | **Player-Friendly Term** | **Context** |
|---|---|---|
| `choosingStance` | "Choose Your Guard" | Phase picker label |
| `choosingAction` | "Your Move" | Phase picker label |
| `choosingSkill` | "Select Technique" | Phase picker label |
| `resolving` | "Strike Unfolds" | Phase picker label |
| "LET IT FALL" | "COMMIT" | Action confirmation button |
| "CRUCIBLE" | "TECHNIQUES" | Skill panel header |
| "VITAE" | "HEALTH" | HP bar label |
| "MIND MARKS" | "FOCUS" | Mental state indicator |
| "STRIFE STIRS" | "BATTLE BEGINS" | Encounter modal sash |

### Battle Log Language Standards

**Before (Engine Terms):**
- "Player executes REND with stance BODY"
- "Enemy applies WITHER effect duration 3"
- "Friendship counter increments by 2"

**After (Player-Friendly):**
- "You strike with [REND] from a defensive stance"
- "Foe weakens you for 3 rounds"  
- "Your bond deepens"

### Glossary Integration

Add contextual help for key concepts without cluttering the UI:
- **Stance:** Your combat posture (tap stance glyphs for brief description)
- **Techniques:** Special abilities beyond basic strikes
- **Focus:** Mental energy affecting ability use
- **Bond:** Relationship strength with the current foe

## 2. Iconography System

### Visual Symbol Standards

#### Stance Glyphs (Keep Current Design, Improve Context)
- **Body stance:** Shield-like symbol = Defensive positioning
- **Heart stance:** Organic curves = Emotional/social approach  
- **Mind stance:** Geometric angles = Analytical/magical focus
- **Add context on hover/press:** Brief tooltip explaining stance benefits

#### Combat Action Icons
| **Action** | **Icon Treatment** | **Visual Cue** |
|---|---|---|
| Attack | Crossed weapons | Sharp, angular shapes in rust |
| Defend | Shield outline | Solid, protective geometry in bone |
| Skill/Technique | Stylized star | Dynamic burst shape in sulfur |
| Item | Pouch/bottle | Curved, container-like in parchment |
| Flee | Exit arrow | Directional movement in ash |

#### Status Effect Chips
- **Beneficial effects:** Subtle upward-pointing triangle accent
- **Harmful effects:** Subtle downward-pointing triangle accent  
- **Neutral effects:** No directional accent
- **Duration indication:** Pip count or fading opacity gradient

#### Progress Indicators
- **Round counter:** Roman numerals (I, II, III) instead of raw numbers
- **Phase progression:** Connected dots showing current step
- **Health bars:** Maintain current design but add clearer labeling

### Icon Accessibility
- **No color-only communication:** Every icon has shape/pattern differentiation
- **High contrast mode support:** All symbols readable against any background
- **Touch target sizing:** Minimum 44pt for interactive elements

## 3. Information Hierarchy

### Primary Information (Always Prominent)
1. **Current player health** — Largest, clearest bar
2. **Available actions** — Central, well-spaced buttons  
3. **Current phase** — Clear state indicator
4. **Enemy health** — Secondary but visible

### Secondary Information (Contextual Display)
1. **Effect chips** — Grouped by beneficial/harmful
2. **Round count** — Present but not dominant
3. **Friendship meter** — Visible when relevant to encounter
4. **Stance indicators** — Active during stance selection

### Tertiary Information (Progressive Disclosure)
1. **Battle log detail** — Scrollable, condensed by default
2. **Technique descriptions** — On-demand via tap/press
3. **Effect descriptions** — Tooltip system
4. **Combat statistics** — Hidden unless explicitly requested

### Visual Grouping Principles
- **Related information clusters together** — All player stats in one area
- **Action-consequence proximity** — Buttons near their result displays
- **Consistent positioning** — Same info types always in same screen regions
- **Breathing room** — Adequate spacing prevents visual crowding

## 4. Specific Fixes for Playtest Findings

### [F02] Encounter Jargon → Player-Friendly Terminology

**Problem:** Technical language creates barrier to entry
**Solution:** Replace all engine terminology with natural language

**Implementation Guide:**
- Update all presenter copy constants to use player-friendly terms
- Maintain engine terminology in code, translate at presentation layer
- Add brief contextual hints for complex concepts

### [F04] Battle Log Ability Names → Clear, Consistent Naming

**Problem:** Engine ability IDs show up as uppercase technical names
**Solution:** Create display name mapping system

**Implementation Guide:**
- Map engine skill IDs to descriptive names ("REND" → "Savage Strike")
- Use consistent naming patterns (Action + Target: "Strike Enemy", "Heal Self")
- Show technique effects in parentheses ("Heal Self (+5 Health)")

### [F05] LET Phase Numbers → Meaningful Progress Indicators

**Problem:** "LET IT FALL" and phase numbers confuse players
**Solution:** Replace with clear action language and visual progress

**Implementation Guide:**
- "LET IT FALL" → "COMMIT" (direct action language)
- Phase numbers → Progress dots or step indicators
- Current phase highlighted, future phases dimmed
- Past phases collapsed with summary of choice made

### [F06] CRUCIBLE Symbols → Comprehensible Iconography

**Problem:** Technical symbols require mental translation
**Solution:** Self-explanatory icons with consistent visual language

**Implementation Guide:**
- Replace abstract symbols with recognizable icons
- Ensure each technique type has distinctive visual character
- Add brief descriptions on long-press for complex techniques
- Group similar techniques visually (offensive, defensive, utility)

## 5. Layout Recommendations

### Current Layout Strengths (Preserve)
- **Three-panel combat structure** — Enemy panel, log, player actions work well
- **Vertical phase progression** — Natural top-to-bottom flow
- **Player HUD at bottom** — Familiar mobile game pattern

### Recommended Improvements

#### Enemy Panel Enhancements
- **Larger health bar** — Make enemy HP more prominent for tactical decisions
- **Grouped status effects** — Beneficial and harmful effects in separate clusters
- **Stance indicator clarity** — Bigger stance glyph, clearer labeling

#### Battle Log Optimization
- **Condensed default view** — Show only last 2-3 actions by default
- **Expandable detail** — Tap to see full log history
- **Color coding** — Use existing severity colors but with better contrast
- **Auto-scroll** — New entries always visible

#### Action Selection Improvements  
- **Larger touch targets** — Especially for technique selection
- **Clear action flow** — Visual connection between phases
- **Undo capability** — Visual indication when choices can be changed
- **Confirmation clarity** — Make "commit" action unmistakable

#### Mobile-Specific Considerations
- **Thumb-friendly zones** — Most-used actions in comfortable reach
- **Landscape orientation** — Maintain usability when device rotated
- **Safe area compliance** — No critical UI in notch/gesture areas
