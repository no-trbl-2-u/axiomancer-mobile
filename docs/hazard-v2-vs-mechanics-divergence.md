# Hazard Minigame: Mobile v2 Engine vs `axiomancer-mechanics` — Divergence Catalogue

Date: 2026-06-11
Status: Authoritative for current mobile `state/hazard/`; refreshed after the 2026-06-11 card-expansion (two-tone cards, enchantments, bursts, gold vow, choose, convert→gold). Roster + mechanics spec: `docs/hazard-card-expansion-2026-06-11-spec.md`.

## Why this document exists

Mobile still carries the living Hazard v2 rules locally. `axiomancer-mechanics` now contains a partial v2 Hazard implementation, but it is not equivalent to mobile and cannot yet replace the mobile engine. This document is the upstreaming checklist: mechanics must either port each current mobile rule below or explicitly reject it with rationale before mobile deletes its local engine and consumes package exports again.

## Current mobile v2 rule surface

### Session flow

- `createHazardSession(seed, deckBag, hazardId)` opens directly in `route-select`.
- Opening hand is visible before route choice: 5 cards drawn, 0 dice cast.
- Route choice is binding for the whole hazard and casts exactly 4 dice once.
- Phase order: `route-select` → `rolling` → `playing` → `resolve-flash` → `outcome` → `rewards` → `done`.
- `rolling` is an animation/interstitial state; rules begin at `playing`.
- Current mobile authored hazards all have 3 rounds.

### Progress and routes

- Progress keys are exactly `force` and `escape`.
- Safe route uses one combined `FORCE + ESCAPE` threshold per round.
- Risk route uses dual per-round thresholds `[force, escape]`; both meters must clear in the same round.
- Marks are `O` / `X` / `pending`; final scoring is tiered, not `O - X` arithmetic.

### Dice and powering

- Card/dice colours are exactly `red`, `blue`, `purple`, `gold`.
- Hostile die face is `hex` in mobile code and displayed as `✕` in UI/docs.
- Die faces are six slots: `red`, `blue`, `purple`, `gold`, `gold`, `hex`.
- Gold is wild for powering non-gold cards: a gold die can power any card colour.
- Gold cards still require gold dice because no non-gold die can satisfy a gold card.
- TWO-TONE cards (reward pool) declare `colors: HazardColor[]`; either listed colour's die — or the wild gold die — powers them (`dieCanPowerCard`). `kind` stays the primary identity.
- Four dice are cast once at route selection.
- Dice do not automatically re-cast or refresh between rounds.
- Spent dice stay spent across rounds.
- Hex dice cannot power cards.
- Re-powering a staged, unapplied card with another legal die frees the previous die.
- Temporary dice created by effects or salvage behave like normal dice and persist until spent or the hazard ends.

### Cards, apply step, and hand economy

- Starter deck has 11 authored cards with weights; starter draw bag total is 25 card ids at `starterWeightScale = 1`.
- Reward pool has 30 cards (8 original + 22 in the 2026-06-11 expansion). The expansion is reward-pool ONLY — the starter bag and its balance sim are unchanged.
- CRACK is a dead card added by consequence.
- `HAZARD_HAND_SIZE = 5`.
- There is no current play-area cap; the whole hand can be staged.
- Staged number cards contribute projected progress immediately.
- Utility effects do **not** fire on stage or on power. They fire when `applyHazardCard` runs, or automatically during `resolveHazardRound` for any staged unapplied cards.
- Applying a card is a one-way commit: applied cards cannot be unstaged, re-powered, or discarded.
- Played/staged cards discard at round advance.
- Unplayed hand persists across rounds.
- At round advance, draw back up to 5; if draw effects inflate the hand above 5, keep everything and draw nothing.
- Draw pile refills by shuffling the current deck bag when low.
- Deck bag = implicit starter bag + acquired reward cards + acquired CRACK cards decoded from `GameState.flags`.

### Card rows and utilities

- Non-dead cards have free values `f/e` and optional powered values `fp/ep`.
- Utility cards can also carry progress numbers; they are not automatically zero-progress.
- Purple utility cards generally have minor effects that upgrade when powered.
- Gold cards use `majorEffect`: the utility fires at major tier even without a die; a gold die buys their numbers.
- Current utility effects are:
  - `draw`: draw `drawBase` cards, or `drawPowered`/major amount at major tier.
  - `recast`: re-roll only currently available dice; major tier also adds one temporary non-hex mana die.
  - `convert`: mint WILD GOLD dice (never the card colour — otherwise re-cast is strictly better). Minor (unpowered) turns exactly ONE available `hex` die to gold; major (powered, or gold `majorEffect`) turns them ALL, and conjures one floating gold die when ≤1 was converted so major always beats minor.
  - `aura` (ENCHANT, expansion): adds persistent session `modifiers` for the rest of the hazard — `auraForce`/`auraEscape` (+X to EVERY played card contributing that meter) and `surgeForce`/`surgeEscape` (+X to every POWERED card's contribution). Red/blue auras upgrade their NUMBER on power, aura flat; purple auras keep the number flat and upgrade the AURA; gold auras fire major for free and the die buys numbers. The aura boosts a card only in the round it is PLAYED: it lifts the round's clear check (`hazardProjectedProgress`), but momentum carry is computed from the RAW, un-enchanted total (`hazardProjectedProgressRaw`), so the aura is never banked into the surplus and re-counted in later rounds' totals (2026-06-12 fix).
  - `burst` (expansion): adds progress to the CURRENT round only (rides `progressBase`). `burstPerUnspentDieForce` adds force per unspent non-hex die (WAR-CRY); `vitaeCost` accrues a VITAE cost settled at claim (BLOODPRICE).
  - `goldvow` (expansion): primes a one-shot `session.goldVow` consumed by the next gold die spent powering a card; the bonus rides that card as `vowBonus`.
- CHOOSE cards (`choose: true`, e.g. TWIN PATHS) feed their single powered value into ONE meter the player picks (`entry.chosenKey`, default `force`), set via `chooseHazardCardKey`.
- The `momentumBonus` rider raises the per-session momentum cap (`momentumCap`, default 3) on apply (SAINT'S PATIENCE).
- Utility effects fire once per card because application locks the card.
- CRACK is dead: contributes nothing, cannot be powered, and only clogs the hand unless discarded.

### Trash bin / salvage

- Only hand cards can currently be discarded through `discardHazardCard`.
- To abandon a staged card, return it to hand first; applied cards can never be binned.
- Cards with `salvage: { type: 'progress', key, amount }` add progress to `progressBase` for the current round only.
- Cards with `salvage: { type: 'mana' }` conjure a temporary die of the card colour.
- Cards without salvage, including CRACK, discard for nothing; thinning is the benefit.
- Round advance overwrites `progressBase` with momentum carry, so progress salvage does not persist.

### Momentum and reserves

- Cleared-round surplus carries half into the next round, capped at 3 per carried meter.
- Carry is computed from the RAW (un-enchanted) round total, so persistent auras never compound across rounds via momentum — they only ever boost the round their cards are played in.
- Safe route carry is based on combined surplus and is stored on `carryForce`, with `carryEscape = 0`.
- Risk route carry is computed separately per meter.
- No carry occurs on failed rounds or after the final round.
- On Complete or Perfect, each unspent non-hex die grants +1 VITAE reserve bonus.
- Failure grants no reserve bonus.

### Sub-quests (optional objectives, 2026-06-12)

- Each hazard rolls `HAZARD_TUNING.subquests.pickCount` (3) objectives from `HAZARD_SUBQUESTS` (10 total), off an INDEPENDENT seeded stream so selection never perturbs the card/dice RNG.
- Rolling metrics (`session.questMetrics`) accrue at the resolve / discard / apply seams; objective pass/fail logic lives in `hazardSubquestStatus`. Invariant breaks (hand emptied, card cap exceeded, a round lost) fail immediately; "reach N by the end" objectives stay `active` until the final resolve.
- Completing an objective on a SURVIVED crossing pays its bonus (`questShillings`/`questVitae`/`questTokens`) on top of the spoils; a total failure forfeits all objective bonuses. Bonuses are applied at claim alongside the main rewards.

### Outcomes, rewards, and consequences

- Outcome tiers:
  - `perfect`: all rounds clear.
  - `complete`: at least one round clears.
  - `failure`: zero rounds clear.
- Perfect safe rewards: `cache`, `vitae`, `token`.
- Perfect risk rewards: `cache`, `relic`, `token`.
- Complete safe rewards: `vitae`.
- Complete risk rewards: `cache` if one win, `cache` + `relic` if two wins.
- Failure grants no rewards and no card offer.
- Non-failure outcomes roll a pick-1-of-3 reward card offer.
- Perfect offers guarantee a rare as the first card and may be skipped.
- Single-win Complete offers have 0% rare chance.
- Non-perfect offers cannot be skipped.
- Consequence ladder by losses:
  - 0 losses: none.
  - 1 loss: `tokens`.
  - 2 losses: `maxhp`, `deadcard`.
  - 3 losses: `minhp`, `maxhp`, `deadcard`, `curse`.
- Route penalty is `penaltyVitae × losses`.
- Claim applies rewards, reserve bonus, consequences, route penalty, and picked card.
- VITAE floors at 1; hazards maim, never kill.

### Current mobile authored content

Starter cards:

- Red starter: `steps`, `haul`, `grip`.
- Blue starter: `scram`, `runner`, `leap`.
- Purple starter: `footing`, `windread`, `pole`.
- Gold starter: `oath`, `blessing`.

Reward/consequence cards:

- Reward cards (original): `r_grip`, `r_wind`, `r_even`, `r_conv`, `r_seer`, `r_gale`, `r_oath`, `r_crown`.
- Reward cards (2026-06-11 expansion): two-tone pivots `r_pivot`, `r_drop`, `r_last`; lopsided duals `r_heave`, `r_skitter`; number+utility hybrids `r_path`, `r_windcall`, `r_stone`, `r_tide`; enchantments `r_aggr`, `r_swift`, `r_zeal`, `r_martyr`, `r_relic`; gold vow `r_vow`; bursts `r_serk`, `r_bolt`, `r_warcry`, `r_blood`, `r_pwrath`; choose `r_twin`; tempo `r_saint`.
- Consequence card: `crack`.

Hazards:

- `cracked-cliff`
  - Safe thresholds: `[19, 21, 23]`, penalty VITAE 2.
  - Risk thresholds: `[[9, 9], [10, 10], [11, 11]]`, penalty VITAE 4.
- `flooded-undercroft`
  - Safe thresholds: `[18, 21, 24]`, penalty VITAE 2.
  - Risk thresholds: `[[8, 10], [9, 11], [10, 12]]`, penalty VITAE 4.
- `ashfall-crossing`
  - Safe thresholds: `[21, 21, 23]`, penalty VITAE 2. (Raised from `[20, 20, 22]` on 2026-06-11: the convert→gold buff lifted safe perfect rate to ~0.80, over the 0.78 band.)
  - Risk thresholds: `[[10, 8], [10, 10], [12, 10]]`, penalty VITAE 4.
- `famine-march`
  - Safe thresholds: `[19, 21, 23]`, penalty VITAE 2.
  - Risk thresholds: `[[9, 9], [10, 10], [11, 11]]`, penalty VITAE 4.
- `bandit-hunt`
  - Safe thresholds: `[18, 21, 24]`, penalty VITAE 2.
  - Risk thresholds: `[[8, 10], [9, 11], [10, 12]]`, penalty VITAE 4.
- `fever-rot`
  - Safe thresholds: `[21, 21, 23]`, penalty VITAE 2. (Raised from `[20, 20, 22]` on 2026-06-11, same reason as `ashfall-crossing`.)
  - Risk thresholds: `[[10, 8], [10, 10], [12, 10]]`, penalty VITAE 4.

Reward/consequence constants:

- `vitae` reward: +6 VITAE.
- `cache` reward: +12 shillings.
- `relic` reward: +20 shillings.
- `minhp` consequence: −8 VITAE.
- `maxhp` consequence: −5 max VITAE, with max VITAE floor 5.

### Mobile-side mappings that need first-class mechanics support

These are live in mobile as best-effort adapters and should become mechanics-owned systems where possible:

- Persistent hazard deck flags: `hazard-card:<cardId>:<n>`.
- Banked token flags: `hazard-token-banked:*`.
- Hexed/curse flag: `hazard-hexed`; combat does not yet consume it.
- Max-VITAE scar recovery: mobile applies the scar, but "until next inn rest" is not wired.
- Cache/relic rewards: currently shillings; a real loot/relic table would be better.
- Out-of-combat death: absent; hazard damage floors VITAE at 1.
- Immediate save on claim: mobile calls `save()` after applying spoils/scars.

## Current `axiomancer-mechanics` state

Mechanics is no longer pure old v0. It has a partial v2 Hazard surface under `src/World/Hazard/`:

- progress keys are `force` / `escape`;
- routes use safe combined thresholds and risk dual thresholds;
- dice are cast once and do not refresh between rounds;
- outcome is Perfect / Complete / Failure;
- there is a seeded session field and hermetic e2e coverage;
- Phase 135 world-persistence hooks exist for some mechanics hazards.

But it remains incompatible with mobile in important ways:

- Mechanics phase order is `reveal` → `hand` → `route-select` → `cast` → `play` → `resolve` → `outcome` → `rewards`, not mobile's route-select-first session with opening hand already drawn.
- Mechanics card identity/content is `A01`...`A14`, `R01`...`R06`, `CRACK`; mobile uses named ids like `steps`, `footing`, `r_crown`, `crack`.
- Mechanics hazard identity/content is `H01`, `H02`, `H03`, `H08`, `H12`, `H15`; mobile uses six named hazards listed above.
- Mechanics dice distribution is still `red`, `blue`, `purple`, `gold`, `x`, `x`; mobile is `red`, `blue`, `purple`, `gold`, `gold`, `hex`.
- Mechanics uses exact colour costs only; mobile treats gold dice as wild for non-gold cards AND supports two-tone cards powered by either of two colours.
- Mechanics convert (where present) targets the card colour; mobile convert mints wild gold dice (minor one / major all + floating). Mobile also adds enchantment (`aura`), `burst`, `goldvow`, and `choose` card behaviours mechanics has no equivalent for.
- Mechanics has a coarser play model: card ids move directly from hand to discard. Mobile has staged card instances, die attachment, explicit apply/lock, unstage, re-power, discard/salvage, and auto-apply at resolve.
- Mechanics utility effects are mostly card-id special cases on powered play; mobile utilities fire on apply and support major/free gold effects, temporary dice, and full salvage behavior.
- Mechanics has no mobile-equivalent persistent deck flag helpers or claim adapter contract matching mobile's GameState flags.
- Mechanics still exports compatibility names such as `computeFinalScore`; mobile should not depend on numeric scoring.

## Upstreaming requirements

Mechanics should port the mobile rules as the new source of truth, not preserve compatibility lies. Required public package surface for mobile issue no-trbl-2-u/axiomancer-mobile#333:

- Session creation with explicit seed, deck bag/current run state, and hazard id.
- Route selection, rolling finish, card staging/unstaging, powering, applying, discard/salvage, round resolve, continue, outcome acknowledge, reward claim.
- Pure deterministic engine transitions suitable for mobile store use and hermetic tests.
- Content exports for hazards, cards, keywords, rewards, consequences, tuning constants, and deck-flag helpers.
- Claim/application helper or explicit adapter contract for GameState rewards/consequences.
- Seeded RNG embedded in session state; no naked `Math.random()` inside pure engine.
- Mobile-compatible id/content migration plan, or a deliberate data migration from old mechanics ids to mobile ids.

## Verification to port or mirror

Mirror the mobile coverage, not just current mechanics expectations:

- `state/hazard/__tests__/engine.test.ts`
  - route-select opens with hand before dice.
  - deterministic seeded sessions.
  - exactly 4 dice on route selection.
  - gold wild powering and gold-card-only-gold powering.
  - utility effects fire on apply, not stage/power.
  - apply locks cards; resolve auto-applies unapplied cards.
  - no automatic re-cast between rounds.
  - persistent unplayed hand and draw-up-to-5.
  - trash-bin discard and salvage.
  - Safe combined meter.
  - Risk BOTH-required meters.
  - momentum carry.
  - Perfect/Complete/Failure outcomes.
  - reward offers, skip rules, reserve bonus, deck flags.
- `state/hazard/__tests__/balance.sim.test.ts`
  - greedy-bot balance bands over every authored mobile hazard and both routes.
- `state/e2e/hazard.flow.engine.test.ts`
  - store action flow and GameState application at claim.
- `state/e2e/hazard.screen.test.tsx` and `state/presenters/__tests__/hazard.engine.test.ts`
  - UI/presenter contract where relevant to package exports.

## Balance guard bands currently enforced in mobile

The mobile greedy-bot sim uses 300 seeded runs per hazard/route cell.

Safe route:

- at least-one-win rate ≥ 0.90.
- perfect rate between 0.35 and 0.78.
- failure rate ≤ 0.08.

Risk route:

- at least-one-win rate between 0.75 and 0.98.
- perfect rate between 0.08 and 0.35.
- failure rate between 0.03 and 0.25.
- average wins must be lower than Safe for the same hazard.

## Historical notes

- The v2 design descends from the 2026-06-10 Claude Design handoff, especially the four-colour redesign.
- The no-between-round-recast doctrine is user-confirmed and supersedes both the prototype's every-round re-cast and any safe/risk split recast idea.
- Enchantments (persistent auras) ARE part of mobile v2 as of the 2026-06-11 expansion (the `aura` effect + session `modifiers`); see `docs/hazard-card-expansion-2026-06-11-spec.md`. This supersedes the earlier "enchantments are not part of mobile v2" note.
- Old CDR-0006 docs should be treated as historical until rewritten.
