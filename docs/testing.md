## What "hermetic" means here

A test is **hermetic** if and only if all three of these hold:

1. **Self-contained.** No network requests, no real `AsyncStorage`,
   no real filesystem, no real font loader, no real `Animated` /
   Reanimated driver, no real timers, no real image fetching, no real
   subprocess. The test must run in plain `npm test` with no external
   service.
2. **Deterministic.** No reliance on wall-clock time, real
   `Math.random`, process IDs, or environment variables. Stub
   `Math.random` (and once the engine's seedable RNG ships, swap to
   that). Use `jest.useFakeTimers()` when timing matters.
3. **Isolated.** No shared mutable state across tests. `afterEach`
   restores any `jest.spyOn` mocks. Fixtures are deep-cloned by the
   code under test, not by the test.

If a test reads from the network, opens real `AsyncStorage`, depends
on the system clock, or fails intermittently when run in a different
order, it is not hermetic. Fix it.

## What "e2e" means here

A test is **end-to-end** if it drives the change through the
highest-level public entry point of its module — *not* through a
private helper. The test asserts on observable state (the view-model
returned by a presenter, the rendered text in a component tree, the
engine `GameState` after an action), not on intermediate function
calls.

Examples of e2e entry points by module:

| Module                      | Hermetic e2e entry point                                                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/(tabs)/combat.tsx`     | `selectCombatHudViewModel(state)` in `state/presenters/combat-hud.engine.ts`; component render via `@testing-library/react-native` for the JSX |
| `app/(tabs)/character.tsx`  | `selectCharacterViewModel(state)` in `state/presenters/character.engine.ts`            |
| `app/(tabs)/inventory.tsx`  | `selectInventoryViewModel(state)` in `state/presenters/inventory.engine.ts`            |
| `app/(tabs)/exploration.tsx`| `selectExplorationViewModel(state)` in `state/presenters/exploration.engine.ts`        |
| `app/(tabs)/event.tsx`      | `selectEventViewModel(state)` in `state/presenters/event.engine.ts`                    |
| `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`    | `selectVisibleTabs(inCombat)` in `state/presenters/tabs.engine.ts`                     |
| Engine store lifecycle      | `createGameStore(memoryAdapter, …)` driven through `startCombat` / `updateCombat` / `endCombat` from `axiomancer-mechanics` |
| `components/<X>.tsx`        | `render(<X {...props} />)` → assert on `getByText` / `getByA11yLabel`. Only when the component has branching UI logic worth pinning. |

Unit tests for individual helpers are still welcome, but they do not
satisfy the hermetic-e2e requirement on their own.

## What CANNOT be tested hermetically (today)

- **Real device behaviour** (haptics, real fonts loading, real splash
  screen). Mock `expo-haptics`, `expo-font`, `expo-splash-screen` in
  `jest.setup.ts`.
- **Reanimated worklets running on the UI thread.** Use
  `react-native-reanimated/mock` from the Jest config. Worklet timing
  is therefore not testable here.
- **Push notifications, deep links** — out of scope for hermetic
  tests; cover with manual smoke tests.

If your change touches any of the above, the hermetic e2e test must
target the underlying presenter / engine function. The screen
component test then becomes a thin "renders without crashing + shows
expected text" check.

## File and naming conventions

> **NEVER put non-route files inside `app/`.** Expo Router's
> `require.context` walks every `.ts`/`.tsx` under `app/` and registers
> it as a route, layout, or API endpoint. A file named
> `_layout.engine.ts` is detected as a layout (because its
> basename-before-the-first-dot is `_layout`) and, in production builds,
> can win the layout-conflict tiebreak against the real `_layout.tsx` —
> producing the "Unmatched Route" screen for every child route. Test
> files (`*.test.ts`), mocks (`*.mock.ts`), and engine/presenter helpers
> all leak into the route tree the same way. See
> `state/e2e/route-tree.engine.test.ts` for the guard test that pins
> the allowed routes.

- **Location:**
  - `state/e2e/<feature>.engine.test.ts` for hermetic full-flow
    presenter / state tests. Companion code:
    `state/presenters/<feature>.engine.ts`.
  - `<module>/<file>.test.ts` (outside `app/`) for pure unit tests.
  - `components/<Component>.test.tsx` for render tests of components
    with branching UI.
- **Fixtures / mocks** live in `state/mocks/<feature>.mock.ts` (or any
  location outside `app/`). They must be plain data — no `Math.random`,
  no environment reads.
- **Test utilities** live in `test-utils/` at the repo root. Anything
  that references the `jest` global must never sit inside `app/`.

## Required test categories per implementation

For every non-trivial implementation, the e2e file should cover at
minimum:

1. **Happy path** — the typical success scenario, end-to-end.
2. **Boundary / branch conditions** — every terminal state the change
   can reach (e.g. combat presenter covers all four phases:
   `choosing_stance`, `choosing_action`, `choosing_skill`, `resolving`;
   inventory presenter covers empty / partial / full).
3. **Invariants** — properties that must hold throughout (HP bar
   percentage in `[0, 1]`, view-model strings never `undefined`,
   round counter monotonic, fixtures unmutated, no negative durations).
4. **Lifecycle integration** — at least one test that drives the
   change through the engine's `createGameStore(memoryAdapter, …)`
   lifecycle, asserting expected adapter calls
   (`jest.spyOn(memoryAdapter, 'save')`).

## Reference example (target shape)

The canonical reference test is `app/(tabs)/combat/e2e/combat-hud.engine.test.ts`
(delivered by Spec 01). Until then, copy the structure of the engine
package's `src/Combat/e2e/combat.engine.test.ts` — its top-of-file
comment, its alternating-RNG helper, its three win-condition suites,
and its store-lifecycle suite together demonstrate every property
above.

## Copy-pasteable scaffold

```ts
/**
 * Hermetic E2E Tests — <Module / Feature>
 *
 * Hermetic = self-contained + deterministic + isolated.
 * See docs/testing.md for the full standard.
 */

import { afterEach, describe, it, expect, jest } from '@jest/globals';

import { mockAlternatingRng } from '@/app/test-utils/rng';
// import the public entry point under test
// e.g. import { selectCombatViewModel } from '../combat.engine';

afterEach(() => {
    jest.restoreAllMocks();
});

describe('<feature>: happy path', () => {
    it('drives the change through the public entry point', () => {
        mockAlternatingRng();
        // ...arrange, act, assert on observable state...
    });
});

describe('<feature>: invariants', () => {
    it('preserves <invariant> across N steps', () => {
        // ...
    });
});
```

## Component-test scaffold

```tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import { CombatScreen } from '../combat';
import { combatStateFixture } from '../combat.mock';

describe('CombatScreen render', () => {
    it('renders the stance picker in the choosing_stance phase', () => {
        const { getByText } = render(
            <CombatScreen state={combatStateFixture('choosing_stance')} />
        );
        expect(getByText(/CHOOSE THY STANCE/)).toBeTruthy();
    });
});
```

## PR self-check

Before opening a PR, confirm:

- [ ] At least one new (or modified) test under `app/<route>/e2e/`
      covers the change.
- [ ] The new test runs green via `npm test` — no flakes when run
      twice.
- [ ] Every randomness source is stubbed — no raw `Math.random` in the
      test.
- [ ] No network, no `AsyncStorage`, no real timers, no real fonts, no
      real Reanimated driver in the test path.
- [ ] `jest.restoreAllMocks()` runs in `afterEach`.
- [ ] If the change is screen-only, the underlying presenter logic was
      extracted and tested hermetically.
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm test` are clean.

If you cannot satisfy this list, write a one-paragraph "Hermetic-test
debt" note in the PR description explaining why and what would unblock
it.
