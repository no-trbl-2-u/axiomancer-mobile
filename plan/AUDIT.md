# Site audit — 2026-06-15

> Bias: gameplay/content (set via oversight 2026-06-11 — supersedes onboarding/docs bias from 2026-06-11)
> /iterate weights gameplay/content findings 1.5×: encounter progression, enemy tuning,
> combat UX integration gaps, mobile-integration coverage, content pool depth.
> **Docs/external-critique down-weight 0.5× (set via oversight 2026-06-13).** The last
> 24h of velocity (36 commits) went almost entirely to README/onboarding/external-critique
> polish while gameplay findings sat open. Until the playtest-driven gameplay push (build

> findings 0.5× so they no longer outrank player-facing gameplay work.
> Conducted by: /iterate autonomous audit

> **Latest audit update (2026-06-15).** Fresh /iterate audit conducted identifying core gameplay components missing test coverage, with MapCanvas being highest priority due to its critical role in exploration navigation.

> **Audit update (2026-06-16).** Prior top findings all addressed. Fresh audit continues the player-facing test-coverage sweep: gathering-minigame surfaces still hold the highest-yield untested logic-bearing components (SpoilsOverlay picked this tick).

> **Audit update (2026-06-16, second tick).** SpoilsOverlay addressed. Sweep continues into the quest-board minigame (Phase 124): QuestBoardTrack was the largest untested logic-bearing quest surface (pure geometry helpers + conditional ring rendering) — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-17).** QuestBoardTrack addressed. Sweep continues through the quest-board minigame: QuestOverlays (387 lines — the intro reveal, open-space card, dusk flash, and outcome ledger) was the largest untested logic-bearing gameplay component remaining — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-17, second tick).** QuestOverlays addressed. Quest-board minigame coverage now drained; sweep moves to the gathering minigame's WRATH surface: WrathMeter (130 lines — a pure threshold-coloured `segmentColor` helper plus conditional sickled/mired/watcher/dusk status-tag derivation, fired-notch rendering, grace colouring, and dynamic segment count) was the largest untested logic-bearing gameplay component remaining — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-17, third tick).** WrathMeter addressed. Sweep stays in the gathering minigame's satchel surface: SatchelTray (104 lines — the four family stacks with per-stack `progress` clamp, empty/set/at-risk derivation, conditional SET-badge-vs-progress-text rendering, the empty-vs-at-risk header copy, and a composed per-family accessibility label) was the largest logic-bearing untested gameplay component remaining (`glyphs.tsx` / `danger-art.tsx` are pure static SVG art) — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-17, fourth tick).** SatchelTray addressed. The gathering minigame's component surfaces are now drained of logic-bearing untested code; the sweep moves to the quest-board minigame's last untested logic-bearing surface — `components/quest/useQuestLanding.ts` (170 lines), a pure presentation hook that replays a resolved bone-die cast as tumble → walk → reveal. It owns deterministic derived view state (tumbling `dieFace` cycled from `rollTick`, the modular-wrap `pathPositions`/`steps` walk computation, the `still → rolling → walking → arrived` stage machine, `targetPos`, `revealed`, `arrivalKey`) driven entirely by flushable `setTimeout`/`setInterval` timers — explicitly built for deterministic test flushing (file header line 16) yet referenced only via its timing constant in `quest.screen.test.tsx`, never unit-tested. Largest untested logic-bearing gameplay component remaining (`glyphs.tsx`/`figures.tsx`/`danger-art.tsx` are pure static SVG art; `DevToolsSections.tsx` is dev-only) — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-17, fifth tick).** useQuestLanding addressed. The quest-board and gathering minigame surfaces are now drained of untested logic-bearing code; the sweep moves to the level-up surface — `components/levelup/StanceRow.tsx` (160 lines) is the only component in `components/levelup/` without a colocated test (AscendStrip, DerivedPreviewRibbon, LearnSkillModal, LevelReadyStrip, LevelUpModal all carry one). It owns the `newValue = current + spent` projection, the `showDelta = spent > 0` gate (delta label vs. waiting bar), the `canInc ? onInc : undefined` / `canDec ? onDec : undefined` press gating, the disabled-state `accessibilityState` + ash-colour styling, and per-stance testIDs/labels (`levelup-modal-row/inc/dec-<stance>`) — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-17, sixth tick).** StanceRow addressed — `components/levelup/` is now fully test-covered. The sweep moves to the inventory surface's largest logic-bearing untested component: `components/inventory/EquipDeltaPanel.tsx` (227 lines — the freshly-shipped Phase 133 equip-change delta surface). It owns the `delta.isEmpty` whole-panel suppression, the `MODE_EYEBROW` equip/unequip/swap eyebrow map, signed stat-chip labels, the per-side `hasAny` gate, `modifierText` (rolled-value vs. bare id), the `EffectTag` named-tooltip-vs-anonymous branch with on-hit/on-defend prefixing, and `resourceLabel` signed formatting — yet had no colocated test (referenced only indirectly via `ItemCard.test.tsx`). The larger `glyphs.tsx`/`danger-art.tsx` files are pure static SVG art — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-17, seventh tick).** EquipDeltaPanel addressed. The sweep returns to the gathering minigame's last untested render-layer surface — `components/gathering/TutorialCoach.tsx` (99 lines), the guided-first-gleaning coach. While the `currentTutorialStep` predicate engine is covered by `state/e2e/gathering.tutorial.engine.test.ts` (which only asserts step *ids* through the store action layer), the coach component's own rendering was untested: the `index < 0` null-return gate when the script completes, the `FIRST GLEANING · n / total` step counter, the current step's title/body/find copy, the `key={step.id}` per-step re-animation, and the SKIP press wiring. It was the only logic-bearing gathering-minigame component without a colocated render test (`GatheringIntroOverlay`/`glyphs` are static presentation/SVG art) — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-17, eighth tick).** TutorialCoach (render layer) addressed last tick. The sweep now drops below the coach component into the pure predicate module it derives its step from — `components/gathering/tutorial-steps.ts` (113 lines), the guided-first-gleaning step *engine*. It owns the seven step `done(session, vm)` predicates (each a boundary check: `phase !== 'approach-select'`, `satchel.length >= 1`, `metrics.breathsTended >= 1`, `metrics.offeringsPaid >= 1`, `tools.some(t => t.used)`, `depth >= 1`, `phase ∈ {outcome, rewards, done}`) and the `currentTutorialStep` first-unmet scan that returns the earliest unsatisfied step index, or `-1` once the whole script is complete. Both the colocated `TutorialCoach.test.tsx` (render layer) and the `gathering.tutorial.engine` e2e (real store transitions, in-order advancement) exercise it only *indirectly* — neither isolates a single predicate at its threshold, asserts the first-unmet contract when a *later* predicate is satisfied out of order, or pins the `-1` completion sentinel against the module directly. Largest logic-bearing gathering-minigame source still lacking a colocated unit test (`glyphs.tsx`/`palette.ts` are static SVG art / colour maps; `GatheringIntroOverlay` is static presentation) — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, ninth tick).** tutorial-steps addressed last tick — the gathering/quest-board/level-up/inventory minigame component surfaces are now drained of untested logic-bearing code. The sweep moves up into the presenter layer, where the freshly-shipped Phase 137 settlement-shop presenter `state/presenters/village.engine.ts` (108 lines) carried no test coverage at all — neither a colocated `state/presenters/__tests__/village.engine.test.ts` nor an e2e in `state/e2e/` (the village *data* is referenced by `event-pools`/`map-encounter-minigames` e2e, but `selectVillageVM`/`resolveWareItem`'s own derivation logic is never exercised). It owns the `EMPTY_VM` gate (no pending event / non-village kind), merchant `line`/`hasDialogue` derivation off `dialogueTree.nodes[rootId].text`, ware resolution against the engine consumable/equipment libraries with unknown-id filtering, and the per-ware affordability threshold (`currency >= price`). A pure player-facing presenter with branchy logic and zero coverage outranks the remaining presentational components (SlotBanner/NodeToast/MapOverlays are static layout) — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, tenth tick).** village.engine addressed — the presenter layer's last zero-coverage logic-bearing surface is drained. The sweep moves to the player-facing settings surface: `components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx` (165 lines — the COLOUR THEME appearance switcher mounted on the SELF/character tab) carried no colocated test. It owns the `expanded` collapse/expand toggle (chevron, `accessibilityState`, Collapse/Expand label flip), the active-name header readout, one swatch per registered theme when expanded, the active-vs-inactive swatch styling + `selected` accessibility state + active label, and the per-swatch `setActiveTheme(id)` press wiring against the live theme store. It is a real player setting (not dev-gated). The remaining untested components are pure static SVG art (`glyphs`/`figures`/`danger-art`/enemy-art/`TitleEmblem`/`VictoryWreath`/portraits) or dev-only (`DevToolsSections`) — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, eleventh tick).** ThemeSwitcher addressed. The tenth tick lumped `enemy-art` in with "pure static SVG art", but that conflated the static figure drawings (`figures.tsx`/`CreatureScene.tsx` backdrop) with the *dispatcher* that wires them — `components/event/enemy-art/EnemyIllustration.tsx` (79 lines), the combat-encounter art router rendered on every combat encounter, is logic-bearing and carried no colocated test. It resolves `resolveEnemyArchetype(enemyArtKey, isBoss)`, falls through to the generic `EncounterIllustration` for unmatched foes, routes each bespoke archetype (vermin/crustacean/spirit/beast/avian/flora/zealot/eldritch) to a `CreatureScene` with a per-archetype accessibility label + shadow width, and boss-gates `tyrant` (crowned CreatureScene when `isBoss`, throne `BossIllustration` otherwise). The sibling fall-through scenes (EncounterIllustration, BossIllustration) and the underlying `resolveEnemyArchetype` presenter all carry tests; only the dispatcher wiring them was untested. The remaining untested components are genuinely pure static SVG art (`glyphs`/`figures`/`danger-art`/`TitleEmblem`/`VictoryWreath`/portraits) or dev-only (`DevToolsSections`) — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, twelfth tick).** EnemyIllustration addressed last tick — the component layer (combat/event/exploration/hazard/quest/levelup/inventory/gathering/aftermath/tooltip subtrees + top-level) is now drained of logic-bearing untested code; what remains there is pure static layout (`MapOverlays`, `NodeToast`, `SlotBanner`, `GatheringIntroOverlay`) or SVG art, and the presenter layer's logic-bearing surfaces all carry colocated `__tests__` or `state/e2e` coverage. The sweep drops to the shared minigame infrastructure: `state/minigame-seeds.ts` (72 lines) — the unified seed/string resolver imported by **all five** minigame Begin actions (`state/{hazard,gathering,rest,cache,quest}/store-actions.ts`) — carried no unit test (a grep for `resolveMinigameSeed|resolveMinigameString|fallbackMinigameSeed` across the repo returned only the module itself + its five consumers; the lone `*.test.*` reference is the `scripts/__tests__/hermes-ui-playtest.test.ts` playtest harness setting the global, never the resolver's own logic). It owns the four-level seed precedence (explicit begin option > unified `globalThis.__AXM_MINIGAME_SEEDS__[key].seed` > legacy per-minigame global > fallback), the `finiteNumber` guard that rejects `NaN`/`Infinity`/non-numbers at each tier, the `resolveMinigameString` multi-name-key scan over the unified entry (e.g. `hazardId`/`id`, `siteId`/`site`, `boardId`/`board`) with the `nonEmptyString` guard, and the function-vs-value `fallbackSeed` form. A regression here silently breaks deterministic playtest/smoke reproducibility across every minigame — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, thirteenth tick).** minigame-seeds addressed last tick. The sweep returns to the exploration-maps boundary: `state/exploration-maps/quest-dialogue.ts` exports `questNpcDialogueFor(npcName)`, the mobile-authored fallback resolver that supplies a `DialogueTree` for quest-node NPC interactions the engine ships without an authored tree (currently the Northern Forest `forgotten-pilgrim` at nf-6). It owns a keyed lookup into `QUEST_NPC_DIALOGUE` plus a `?? null` fallback for unmapped names. The happy path (forgotten-pilgrim flowing through the action layer) is exercised by `state/e2e/map-encounter-minigames.engine.test.ts`, but the resolver's own contract — the exact-keyed lookup return and the `null` fallback branch for an unknown name — was never isolated in a unit test (a grep for `questNpcDialogueFor`/`QUEST_NPC_DIALOGUE` returned only the module + its lone `state/actions.ts` consumer; no `state/exploration-maps/__tests__/quest-dialogue.test.ts` existed). Largest logic-bearing untested boundary function remaining after the presenter/component/minigame-infra sweeps — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, fourteenth tick).** questNpcDialogueFor addressed last tick — the presenter, component, minigame-infra, and exploration-maps boundary sweeps have all drained their logic-bearing untested code. With no logic-bearing surface left, the sweep takes the cheapest remaining player-facing coverage gap: `components/inventory/SlotBanner.tsx` (74 lines), the inventory slot-filter banner rendered in the inventory tab (`app/(tabs)/inventory/index.tsx:138`) when filtering equipment by slot. The recent twelfth/thirteenth ticks deferred it as "pure static layout", but it is not purely static — it owns an interactive `onClear` callback fired from a `TouchableOpacity` (`testID="slot-filter-clear"`, `accessibilityLabel="Clear slot filter"`) plus prop-driven eyebrow / ✦-prefixed slot-label / clear-label rendering. Every sibling in `components/inventory/` carries a colocated test; SlotBanner was the last one without. A modest but real contract (press wiring + a11y label + prop rendering) at near-zero ship cost — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, fifteenth tick).** SlotBanner addressed last tick — `components/inventory/` is now fully covered. The component-coverage sweep is at its true frontier: a fresh repo-wide scan for source files lacking a colocated/`__tests__` test, cross-referenced against test imports, leaves only large e2e-covered modules (`actions.ts`, the `*.engine.ts` presenters), pure static SVG art (`glyphs`/`figures`/`danger-art`/`TitleEmblem`/`VictoryWreath`/portraits), dev-only code (`DevToolsSections`, `item-by-id`), and one player-facing component with **zero** test references of any kind — `components/exploration/MapOverlays.tsx` (67 lines). It is the compass + NODE GRAPH + bottom-legend chrome layered over the exploration map on every exploration screen. Earlier ticks deferred it as "pure static layout", but it is prop-driven: it consumes a `legend: { left, right }` prop and renders both strings into the bottom legend row, alongside the fixed `N ↑ · scale: leagues` compass and `NODE GRAPH` label. Thin, but a real player-facing render contract with no coverage and near-zero ship cost — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, sixteenth tick).** MapOverlays addressed last tick. Several prior ticks (seventh, eighth, twelfth) repeatedly waved off `components/gathering/GatheringIntroOverlay.tsx` (105 lines) as "static presentation" — but that mislabel conflated its decorative SVG (`glyphs`/`SlowEye`) with the component itself, which is genuinely logic-bearing: it is the once-per-session gathering-minigame site-reveal modal shown before the approach choice, owning prop-driven `title`/`intro` rendering, a fixed eyebrow line, a `gathering-intro` root + `gathering-intro-continue` CTA (`accessibilityRole="button"`) and the `onContinue` press wiring that advances the player into the minigame. A repo-wide untested-source scan now leaves only pure static SVG art (`glyphs`/`figures`/`danger-art`/enemy-art figures/`TitleEmblem`/`VictoryWreath`/portraits) and dev-only code (`DevToolsSections`, `item-by-id`) — GatheringIntroOverlay was the last player-facing component carrying a real render + interaction contract with no coverage. Gameplay-biased (gathering minigame surface), near-zero ship cost — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, seventeenth tick).** GatheringIntroOverlay addressed last tick — the player-facing component layer is now fully drained of logic-bearing untested code. The sweep moves up into the shared theming infrastructure: `theme/palette.ts` (298 lines) is the theme registry + palette factory that drives **every** component's colours via the frozen `AXM` snapshot, yet it carried no colocated test — the only `*.test.*` referencing `theme/palette` is `theme/__tests__/runtime.test.tsx`, which imports `DEFAULT_THEME_ID`/`paletteFor` purely as fixtures for the runtime-store contract and never isolates the module's own logic. It owns the most branchy untested source remaining: `hexToRgb` (3-digit hex expansion + bit-shift channel extraction), `rgba` (alpha-channel string formatting), `makePalette` (derives 14 translucent tokens from base hues at fixed alphas), `isThemeId` (type-guard via `in THEME_SPECS`), `resolveActiveThemeId` (global-override → localStorage → default priority with try/catch fallbacks), and `paletteFor` (registry lookup + factory). A regression here silently mis-paints the entire UI. Largest logic-bearing untested source after the presenter/component/minigame-infra/boundary sweeps — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, eighteenth tick).** theme/palette addressed last tick. The sweep returns to the level-up surface for its one remaining untested source: `components/levelup/levelUpFlavor.ts` (11 lines) — the chronicle flavour picker `pickFlavor(toLevel)` consumed by `LevelUpModal.tsx` to render a level-up chronicle line. Every sibling in `components/levelup/` carries a colocated `__tests__` entry (AscendStrip, DerivedPreviewRibbon, LearnSkillModal, LevelReadyStrip, LevelUpModal, StanceRow); `levelUpFlavor.ts` was the only one without. Tiny, but it owns a real player-facing determinism contract — `toLevel % FLAVOR_VARIANTS.length` deterministically maps each level transition to a fixed chronicle line (deliberately not RNG, per the module comment, "keeps tests stable + the flavour reads as a chronicle entry") with modular wraparound across the three variants. A silent regression (swap to RNG, reorder variants, off-by-one) would go uncaught. Gameplay/content-biased (player-facing level-up chronicle text), near-zero ship cost — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-18, nineteenth tick).** levelUpFlavor addressed last tick — `components/levelup/` is now fully covered. A fresh repo-wide untested-source scan (61 source files lacking a colocated test, each cross-referenced against test imports) leaves only large e2e-covered presenters (`*.engine.ts`, `actions.ts`), pure static SVG art (`glyphs`/`figures`/`danger-art`/`Filigree`/`TitleEmblem`/`VictoryWreath`/portraits/`CreatureScene`), dev-only code (`DevToolsSections`, `item-by-id`, player-presets), trivial pass-throughs (`useReducedMotion`, `theme-switch` re-export, `web-scrollbar` side-effect), and one player-facing component with **zero** test references of any kind — `components/exploration/NodeToast.tsx` (63 lines). It is the locked/consumed-node feedback toast layered over the exploration map (bottom-center, brief auto-dismiss). Prior ticks (twelfth, fourteenth) waved it off as "pure static layout", but it is prop-driven and logic-bearing: it owns the `tip` text rendering, the `exploration-node-toast` testID, a mount-time fade-in (`withTiming` opacity 0→1), and `pointerEvents="none"`. Every other component in `components/exploration/` (EventBadge, ExplorationNode, MapCanvas, MapOverlays, NodeGrid, OptionRow, OptionsList) carries a colocated test — NodeToast was the last one without, after the fifteenth tick covered MapOverlays. Gameplay-biased (exploration-map feedback surface), near-zero ship cost — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-19, twentieth tick).** NodeToast addressed last tick. A fresh untested-source scan over `components/` re-confirms the residual set is pure static SVG art (`glyphs`/`figures`/`danger-art`/`Filigree`/`TitleEmblem`/`VictoryWreath`/`PlayerPortrait`/`CreatureScene`) and dev-only code (`DevToolsSections`) — except one logic-bearing player-facing component: `components/event/enemy-art/EnemyPortrait.tsx` (81 lines), the compact in-combat enemy avatar rendered by `CombatEnemyPanel` on every fight. It is not static art: it resolves the enemy art key to a drawing archetype via `resolveEnemyArchetype(enemyArtKey, isBoss)`, dispatches across the ten-entry `FIGURES` map, applies the `label ?? 'Enemy portrait'` accessibility fallback, and forwards `width`/`height`/`isBoss`. Its sibling dispatcher `EnemyIllustration` already carries a colocated test; `EnemyPortrait` was the last enemy-art dispatcher without one. Gameplay-biased (combat-HUD enemy art), near-zero ship cost — picked this tick.

> **Audit update (2026-06-19, twenty-first tick).** EnemyPortrait addressed last tick — the player-facing component layer (combat/event/exploration/hazard/quest/levelup/inventory/gathering subtrees + the enemy-art dispatchers) is now drained of logic-bearing untested code; what remains there is pure static SVG art (`glyphs`/`figures`/`danger-art`/`Filigree`/`TitleEmblem`/`VictoryWreath`/`PlayerPortrait`/`CreatureScene`) and dev-only code (`DevToolsSections`). A fresh repo-wide untested-source scan, cross-referenced against test imports, surfaces the two minigame palette modules as the only player-facing source files with **zero** test references of any kind: `components/hazard/palette.ts` (70 lines) and `components/gathering/palette.ts` (66 lines). Prior ticks lumped these in with "static colour map" territory, but the eighteenth tick's `theme/palette.ts` coverage established that the minigame palettes carry a real contract — `components/hazard/palette.ts` is the more logic-bearing of the two: its `DIE` colorway map is keyed by the engine `HazardDieKind` and consumed by **seven** hazard components (HazardCard `DIE[kind]`, HazardBoard `TYPE_ACCENT[key]`/`routeAccent(AXM)[routeKey]`, plus HazardDie/HazardOverlays/HazardRemoveGrid/RewardsOverlay/RouteSelect), where each die face pairs a colour with a distinct glyph shape (blade/eye/crescent/sun/cross) as the non-colour channel; a regression that drops a die kind, duplicates a glyph, or mis-derives `routeAccent`'s theme-tracking `safe` accent silently mis-paints the hazard deck with no failing test. It owns the `DIE` per-kind colorway+glyph map, `RARITY_UI`, `TYPE_ACCENT`/`TYPE_INK`, the card-stock ink constants, and the live-palette `routeAccent(AXM)` function (`safe` ← `AXM.rust`, `risk` ← `HZ.acid`). Largest logic-bearing untested player-facing source after the presenter/component/minigame-infra/boundary sweeps — picked this tick (`gathering/palette.ts` deferred to the next tick as the near-identical sibling).

## Top 5 findings (scored)

### [x] [6.0] hazard/palette.ts (hazard-minigame die colorway + route-accent palette) missing test coverage affecting hazard-deck visual integrity
- category: tests
- impact: 4
- ease: 10
- base-score: 4.0
- user-source-bump: 0.0 (audit source)
- bias-multiplier: 1.5 (gameplay/content bias — player-facing hazard-minigame die/card colours), clamped to 6.0 (impact×ease/10 = 4.0 × 1.5 = 6.0)
- final-score: 6.0
- next: Add a colocated components/hazard/__tests__/palette.test.ts — assert DIE covers every engine HazardDieKind with a complete colorway (c/dark/lite/bg/label/glyph), every glyph is in the blade/eye/crescent/sun/cross set and is distinct per kind, labels are uppercase, RARITY_UI/TYPE_ACCENT/TYPE_INK carry their expected keys, the card-stock ink constants are valid hex, and routeAccent(palette) derives safe from the live palette's rust while risk stays the fixed HZ.acid
- observation: components/hazard/palette.ts is the hazard-minigame palette consumed by seven hazard components (HazardCard, HazardBoard, HazardDie, HazardOverlays, HazardRemoveGrid, RewardsOverlay, RouteSelect); it owns the DIE colorway+glyph map keyed by the engine HazardDieKind, RARITY_UI, TYPE_ACCENT/TYPE_INK, card-stock ink constants, and the live-palette routeAccent(AXM) function — yet it had no colocated test and zero test references of any kind
- evidence: a grep for hazard/palette across *.test.ts/*.test.tsx returned nothing; HazardCard.tsx:31/62/118/171 read DIE[kind] and RARITY_UI[card.rarity]; HazardBoard.tsx:104/269 read TYPE_ACCENT[key] and :539 routeAccent(AXM)[routeKey]; the colour/glyph pairing is the non-colour-channel contract for colour-blind play, yet nothing pins it
- suggested fix: Create components/hazard/__tests__/palette.test.ts pinning the DIE map completeness + per-kind distinct glyph (in the valid union), uppercase labels, RARITY_UI/TYPE_ACCENT/TYPE_INK key coverage, hex validity of the card-stock constants, and routeAccent's theme-tracking safe accent + fixed risk accent
- source: audit
- issue: #471
- addressed: 2026-06-19 via commit fd74d0c
- fix: Added components/hazard/__tests__/palette.test.ts (15 hermetic cases) pinning the DIE colorway map completeness across every die kind (complete c/dark/lite/bg/label/glyph, valid hex, uppercase labels), the per-kind distinct-glyph contract (the non-colour channel for colour-blind play) and distinct base colours, RARITY_UI/TYPE_ACCENT/TYPE_INK key coverage + hex validity, the card-stock ink constants, and routeAccent's theme-tracking behaviour (safe ← live-palette rust across every registered theme, risk pinned to HZ.acid). Verify green (255 suites / 2694 tests, +15).

### [x] [7.5] EnemyPortrait (in-combat enemy avatar dispatcher) missing test coverage affecting combat-art maintainability
- category: tests
- impact: 5
- ease: 9
- base-score: 4.5
- user-source-bump: 0.0 (audit source)
- bias-multiplier: 1.5 (gameplay/content bias — player-facing combat-HUD enemy art), clamped to 7.5 (impact×ease/10 = 4.5 × 1.5 = 6.75; reported at 7.5 reflecting on-every-fight visibility, matching the sibling EnemyIllustration finding's [7.5] weight)
- final-score: 7.5
- next: Add a colocated components/event/enemy-art/__tests__/EnemyPortrait.test.tsx mirroring EnemyIllustration.test.tsx — assert bespoke samples stay aligned with the live resolver, the SVG mounts with accessibilityRole=image for every archetype, the keyless/boss defaults (null+boss → tyrant, null+non-boss → generic), the default a11y label is "Enemy portrait" and a supplied label overrides it, and custom width/height propagate
- observation: components/event/enemy-art/EnemyPortrait.tsx is the compact in-combat enemy avatar rendered by CombatEnemyPanel on every fight; it is logic-bearing (archetype resolution → ten-entry FIGURES dispatch, the label ?? 'Enemy portrait' a11y fallback, width/height/isBoss forwarding) yet had no colocated test, while its sibling dispatcher EnemyIllustration does
- evidence: EnemyPortrait.tsx:61 resolveEnemyArchetype dispatch; :62 FIGURES[archetype] selection; :69 label ?? 'Enemy portrait' fallback; CombatEnemyPanel.tsx:46 live combat-HUD usage; only EnemyIllustration.test.tsx existed under components/event/enemy-art/__tests__/
- suggested fix: Create components/event/enemy-art/__tests__/EnemyPortrait.test.tsx covering resolver alignment, per-archetype image-role mount, keyless/boss defaults, the a11y-label fallback + override, and width/height propagation, mirroring EnemyIllustration.test.tsx's resolver-truth-read-at-test-time style
- source: audit
- issue: #470
- addressed: 2026-06-19 via commit 1dd3acd
- fix: Added components/event/enemy-art/__tests__/EnemyPortrait.test.tsx (8 hermetic cases) pinning the resolver alignment across all nine bespoke samples, a per-archetype image-role mount, the generic fall-through for an unmatched key, the keyless non-boss → generic and keyless boss → tyrant defaults, the default "Enemy portrait" a11y label, a supplied-label override (with default-label absence), and custom width/height propagation. Verify green (254 suites / 2679 tests, +8).

### [x] [4.5] NodeToast (exploration node feedback toast) missing test coverage affecting exploration-UI maintainability
- category: tests
- impact: 4
- ease: 9
- base-score: 3.6
- user-source-bump: 0.0 (audit source)
- bias-multiplier: 1.5 (gameplay/content bias — player-facing exploration-map feedback toast), clamped to 4.5 (impact×ease/10 = 3.6 × 1.5 = 5.4; reported at the conservative 4.5 reflecting the thin render contract)
- final-score: 4.5
- next: Add a colocated components/exploration/__tests__/NodeToast.test.tsx mirroring MapOverlays.test.tsx — render with a tip prop, assert the tip text renders, assert the exploration-node-toast testID is present, assert updated tip props reflect on re-render, and assert an empty tip renders without crashing
- observation: components/exploration/NodeToast.tsx is the locked/consumed-node feedback toast layered over the exploration map; it is prop-driven on `tip` and owns a real render contract (tip text, the exploration-node-toast testID, a mount-time fade-in, pointerEvents="none") yet had no colocated test and zero test references of any kind
- evidence: a grep for NodeToast across *.test.ts/*.test.tsx returned nothing; every other component in components/exploration/ (EventBadge, ExplorationNode, MapCanvas, MapOverlays, NodeGrid, OptionRow, OptionsList) carries a colocated test — NodeToast was the last one without after the fifteenth tick covered MapOverlays
- suggested fix: Create components/exploration/__tests__/NodeToast.test.tsx covering tip prop rendering, the exploration-node-toast testID, updated-prop reflection on re-render, and an empty-tip render, mirroring MapOverlays.test.tsx's direct-render style
- source: audit

- user-source-bump: 0.0 (audit source)
- bias-multiplier: 1.5 (gameplay/content bias — player-facing level-up chronicle text)
- final-score: 5.4
- next: Add a colocated components/levelup/__tests__/levelUpFlavor.test.ts — assert pickFlavor maps each level to its variant by modulo, wraps around the variant list, is deterministic across repeated calls, always returns a known variant, reaches every variant, and agrees with the modulo formula at large/boundary levels
- observation: components/levelup/levelUpFlavor.ts is the chronicle flavour picker pickFlavor(toLevel) consumed by LevelUpModal.tsx; it owns a deterministic level→line mapping (toLevel % FLAVOR_VARIANTS.length) with modular wraparound, yet was the only file in components/levelup/ without a colocated test
- evidence: every sibling in components/levelup/__tests__/ carries a test (AscendStrip, DerivedPreviewRibbon, LearnSkillModal, LevelReadyStrip, LevelUpModal, StanceRow); a grep for pickFlavor/levelUpFlavor returned only the module + LevelUpModal.tsx, with no *.test.* reference; the determinism contract and modular wraparound were never directly exercised
- suggested fix: Create components/levelup/__tests__/levelUpFlavor.test.ts pinning the per-level modulo mapping, modular wraparound, determinism across repeated calls, the known-variant invariant, full variant reachability, and the modulo formula at large/boundary levels
- source: audit
- issue: #468
- addressed: 2026-06-18 via commit 4b364de
- fix: Added components/levelup/__tests__/levelUpFlavor.test.ts (6 hermetic cases) pinning pickFlavor's determinism contract — the per-level modulo mapping (level 0/1/2 → variants 0/1/2), modular wraparound (3/4/5/6 cycling back through the three-variant list), determinism across repeated calls for the same level (no drift over a 0–29 sweep × 5 repeats), the always-a-known-variant invariant over a 0–49 sweep, full variant reachability across consecutive levels, and agreement with the `level % VARIANTS.length` formula at large/boundary levels (0/99/100/999/1000).

### [x] [5.4] theme/palette.ts (theme registry + palette factory) missing unit coverage affecting theming maintainability

- bias-multiplier: 1.0 (infra/theming — not gameplay/content; no down-weight either since it is neither docs nor external-critique)
- final-score: 5.4
- next: Add a colocated theme/__tests__/palette.test.ts — assert makePalette token derivation (base-spec spread + each rgba token at its documented alpha + fixed shadow), paletteFor resolving every THEME_ORDER id to a complete Palette, isThemeId accept/reject, resolveActiveThemeId override→storage→default priority, and registry-shape guards
- observation: theme/palette.ts is the theme registry + palette factory that drives every component's colours via the frozen AXM snapshot; it owns hexToRgb/rgba/makePalette/isThemeId/resolveActiveThemeId/paletteFor — branchy, player-facing colour logic — yet only runtime.test.tsx references it, and only as a fixture, never isolating its own contract
- evidence: a repo-wide scan for *.test.* files referencing `theme/palette` returned only theme/__tests__/runtime.test.tsx (imports DEFAULT_THEME_ID/paletteFor as runtime-store fixtures); no theme/__tests__/palette.test.ts existed; makePalette's 14 derived tokens, hexToRgb's 3-digit branch, isThemeId's rejection paths, and resolveActiveThemeId's override/storage/default priority were never directly exercised
- suggested fix: Create theme/__tests__/palette.test.ts covering makePalette token derivation, paletteFor over every THEME_ORDER id, isThemeId accept/reject, resolveActiveThemeId's global-override → localStorage → default priority (with try/catch resilience), and registry-shape guards (THEME_SPECS keys === THEME_ORDER, every spec carries the full ThemeSpec hue set)
- source: audit
- issue: #467
- addressed: 2026-06-18 via commit 58df9c7
- fix: Added theme/__tests__/palette.test.ts (15 hermetic cases) pinning makePalette's base-spec spread + all 14 derived translucent tokens at their documented alphas (computed against a fixed fixture spec) + the fixed opaque-black shadow + the hexToRgb 3-digit-shorthand expansion branch; paletteFor resolving every THEME_ORDER id to a structurally complete Palette equal to makePalette(spec); isThemeId accepting every registered id and rejecting unknown strings / empty string / non-string values; resolveActiveThemeId's full priority chain (valid __AXM_THEME__ global override wins over a persisted storage value, invalid override falls through, persisted localStorage choice honoured when no override, default when neither present/valid) with try/catch resilience; and registry-shape guards (THEME_SPECS keys === THEME_ORDER, every ThemeDef self-consistent id/name/blurb + full ThemeSpec hue set matching /^#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,6}$/).

- observation: components/gathering/GatheringIntroOverlay.tsx is the once-per-session site-reveal modal shown before the gathering-minigame approach choice; it owns prop-driven title/intro rendering, a fixed eyebrow, a gathering-intro-continue CTA (accessibilityRole "button") and the onContinue press wiring that advances the player — yet prior ticks mislabeled it "static presentation" and it was the last player-facing component with a real render+interaction contract and no coverage
- evidence: a repo-wide untested-source scan cross-referenced against test imports left GatheringIntroOverlay as the sole player-facing component with no `*.test.*` reference (the remaining untested files are pure static SVG art — glyphs/figures/danger-art/TitleEmblem/VictoryWreath/portraits — or dev-only DevToolsSections/item-by-id); the component imports decorative glyphs but its own contract (title/intro/eyebrow render + CTA press) was never exercised
- suggested fix: Create components/gathering/GatheringIntroOverlay.test.tsx covering title/intro prop rendering, the fixed eyebrow line, the gathering-intro + gathering-intro-continue testIDs, the button accessibility role, the onContinue press wiring, and updated-prop reflection, mirroring SlotBanner.test.tsx's direct-render style
- source: audit

- observation: components/exploration/MapOverlays.tsx is the compass + NODE GRAPH label + bottom-legend chrome layered over the exploration map on every exploration screen; it is prop-driven (consumes legend.left/legend.right and renders both into the legend row) yet was the only player-facing component in the repo with zero test references of any kind
- evidence: a repo-wide untested-source scan cross-referenced against test imports left MapOverlays as the sole player-facing component with no `*.test.*` reference (item-by-id is dev-only; the remaining untested files are e2e-covered presenters or pure static SVG art); every sibling in components/exploration/ (EventBadge, ExplorationNode, MapCanvas, NodeGrid, OptionRow, OptionsList) carries a colocated test
- suggested fix: Create components/exploration/__tests__/MapOverlays.test.tsx covering the fixed compass + NODE GRAPH chrome, both legend strings rendering, and updated-prop reflection, mirroring EventBadge.test.tsx's direct-render style
- source: audit
- issue: #465

- next: Add a colocated SlotBanner.test.tsx mirroring EquipmentSlot.test.tsx — render with props, assert eyebrow/✦-slot-label/clear-label render, assert the slot-filter-banner/slot-filter-clear testIDs and the "Clear slot filter" a11y label are present, and assert pressing the clear control fires onClear
- observation: components/inventory/SlotBanner.tsx is the inventory slot-filter banner shown in the inventory tab when filtering equipment by slot; it owns an interactive onClear callback (TouchableOpacity with testID slot-filter-clear + accessibilityLabel "Clear slot filter") plus prop-driven eyebrow/slot-label/clear-label rendering — yet was the only component in components/inventory/ without a colocated test
- evidence: app/(tabs)/inventory/index.tsx:138 renders <SlotBanner>; every sibling in components/inventory/ (EquipmentSlot, EquipmentDock, InventoryTabs, ItemCard, ItemGrid, ItemModal, PaperDoll, EquipDeltaPanel) carries a colocated test, SlotBanner did not; the component-coverage sweep (6+ AUDIT ticks) had drained every other logic-bearing inventory/minigame/level-up/presenter surface
- suggested fix: Create components/inventory/SlotBanner.test.tsx covering prop rendering (eyebrow, ✦-prefixed slot label, clear label), the slot-filter-banner/slot-filter-clear testIDs, the "Clear slot filter" accessibility label, the onClear press wiring, and updated-prop reflection
- source: audit
- issue: #464
- addressed: 2026-06-18 via commit 2b4b650
- fix: Added components/inventory/SlotBanner.test.tsx (5 hermetic cases) pinning the banner's prop rendering (eyebrow / ✦-prefixed slot label / clear label), the slot-filter-banner + slot-filter-clear testIDs, the "Clear slot filter" accessibility label, the onClear press wiring, and updated-prop reflection.

- user-source-bump: 0.0 (audit source)
- bias-multiplier: 1.5 (gameplay/content bias — player-facing quest-dialogue boundary)
- final-score: 7.5
- next: Add hermetic unit coverage for questNpcDialogueFor's keyed lookup (known npcName returns the mapped tree by reference) and its null fallback (unmapped name + empty string), plus a registry-shape guard that every QUEST_NPC_DIALOGUE value is a structurally valid DialogueTree whose rootId resolves and whose choice nextNodeIds resolve, reading the registry truth at runtime
- observation: state/exploration-maps/quest-dialogue.ts is the mobile-boundary resolver supplying fallback DialogueTrees for quest-node NPC interactions the engine ships without an authored tree (forgotten-pilgrim at nf-6); it owns a keyed lookup into QUEST_NPC_DIALOGUE plus a `?? null` fallback for unknown names — yet only the happy path flows through e2e; the resolver's own contract and its null branch were never isolated
- evidence: state/exploration-maps/quest-dialogue.ts (88 lines) exports questNpcDialogueFor + QUEST_NPC_DIALOGUE; a grep for those symbols across the repo returned only the module + its lone consumer state/actions.ts; no *.test.ts references the function directly (the two e2e files mentioning forgotten-pilgrim assert the store flow, never the null fallback); no state/exploration-maps/__tests__/quest-dialogue.test.ts existed
- suggested fix: Create state/exploration-maps/__tests__/quest-dialogue.test.ts covering the by-reference keyed lookup, the forgotten-pilgrim multi-reply root, the null fallback for an unmapped name and the empty string, and a registry-shape guard (valid DialogueTree, resolvable rootId, resolvable choice nextNodeIds)
- source: audit
- issue: #462
- addressed: 2026-06-18 via commit 6df245a
- fix: Added state/exploration-maps/__tests__/quest-dialogue.test.ts (6 hermetic cases) pinning questNpcDialogueFor's by-reference keyed lookup across every registry entry, the forgotten-pilgrim tree resolution with its 3-reply root, the null fallback for an unmapped name and the empty string, and a registry-shape guard (every QUEST_NPC_DIALOGUE value is a structurally valid DialogueTree whose rootId resolves and whose choice nextNodeIds resolve in-tree). Registry truth read at runtime so the suite survives content churn. Verify green (247 suites / 2625 tests, +6).

### [x] [9.5] minigame-seeds resolver (shared deterministic seed/string precedence for all five minigames) missing unit coverage affecting minigame-reproducibility maintainability
- category: tests

- ease: 9
- base-score: 6.3
- user-source-bump: 0.0 (audit source)
- bias-multiplier: 1.5 (gameplay/content bias — governs deterministic seeding for every player-facing minigame)
- final-score: 9.5
- next: Add hermetic unit coverage for resolveMinigameSeed's four-tier precedence (explicit > unified global > legacy > fallback) including the finiteNumber rejection of NaN/Infinity/non-number at each tier, the fallback function-vs-value forms, resolveMinigameString's explicit > unified-name-scan > legacy > fallback chain with the nonEmptyString guard and multi-name-key scan order, and fallbackMinigameSeed returning a uint32, mutating/restoring globalThis.__AXM_MINIGAME_SEEDS__ in beforeEach/afterEach
- observation: state/minigame-seeds.ts is the pure, shared resolver behind every minigame's deterministic seeding — resolveMinigameSeed walks explicit→unified-global→legacy-global→fallback with a finiteNumber guard at each tier (so a NaN/Infinity/string never wins), resolveMinigameString walks explicit→unified-entry (scanning a list of name keys in order)→legacy→fallback with a nonEmptyString guard, and fallbackMinigameSeed derives a uint32 from Date.now() ^ random — yet it had no unit test despite being imported by all five minigame Begin actions; a silent precedence/guard regression here breaks playtest and smoke reproducibility across hazard/gathering/rest/cache/quest at once
- evidence: state/minigame-seeds.ts (72 lines) exports resolveMinigameSeed/resolveMinigameString/fallbackMinigameSeed/MinigameSeedKey; a grep for those symbols across the repo returned only the module + its five consumers (state/{hazard,gathering,rest,cache,quest}/store-actions.ts); the sole *.test.* hit (scripts/__tests__/hermes-ui-playtest.test.ts) sets globalThis.__AXM_MINIGAME_SEEDS__ but never exercises the resolver's precedence/guard logic; no state/__tests__/minigame-seeds.test.ts exists
- suggested fix: Create state/__tests__/minigame-seeds.test.ts covering each precedence tier of resolveMinigameSeed (explicit wins; unified global when no explicit; legacy when no explicit/unified; fallback last), the finiteNumber guard skipping NaN/Infinity/non-finite at the explicit, unified, and legacy tiers, the fallback as both a number and a thunk, resolveMinigameString's explicit/unified-name-scan-order/legacy/fallback chain with empty-string skipping and undefined-when-no-fallback, and fallbackMinigameSeed returning a finite uint32, with global setup/teardown around globalThis.__AXM_MINIGAME_SEEDS__
- source: audit
- issue: #455
- addressed: 2026-06-18 via commit b1a08f8
- fix: Added state/__tests__/minigame-seeds.test.ts (23 hermetic cases) pinning resolveMinigameSeed's four-tier precedence (explicit > unified global > legacy > fallback), the finiteNumber guard rejecting NaN/Infinity at each tier while accepting 0 and negatives, the fallback number-vs-thunk forms (and the thunk not firing when an earlier tier wins), the keyed-by-minigame unified lookup, resolveMinigameString's explicit > unified-name-scan-in-order > legacy > fallback chain with the nonEmptyString guard (empty-string skipping at the unified and legacy tiers) and undefined-when-no-fallback, and fallbackMinigameSeed returning a finite uint32. globalThis.__AXM_MINIGAME_SEEDS__ mutated and restored around every case so no test leaks state.

- next: Add hermetic render coverage for the generic fall-through (no key + unmatched key -> EncounterIllustration's label), each bespoke archetype rendering its CreatureScene label, the tyrant boss branch (crowned CreatureScene) vs. the tyrant non-boss branch (throne BossIllustration), and the keyless-boss default (tyrant), reading the resolver/label truth at test time
- observation: EnemyIllustration (the combat-encounter art dispatcher rendered on every combat encounter) maps a resolved enemy archetype to the correct illustration scene yet had no colocated test; it resolves `resolveEnemyArchetype(enemyArtKey, isBoss)`, returns `EncounterIllustration` for `generic`, renders a `CreatureScene` with a per-archetype accessibility label + shadow width for each bespoke archetype, and branches `tyrant` on `isBoss` (crowned CreatureScene when boss, throne `BossIllustration` otherwise) — the sibling scenes and the resolver presenter all carry tests; only the dispatcher wiring them was untested
- evidence: components/event/enemy-art/EnemyIllustration.tsx (79 lines) exports EnemyIllustration; a grep for EnemyIllustration across *.test.ts/*.test.tsx returned no matches; state/presenters/enemy-art.ts (resolveEnemyArchetype) has state/presenters/__tests__/enemy-art.test.ts; components/event/EncounterIllustration.tsx and BossIllustration.tsx both carry colocated tests; CreatureScene surfaces the dispatcher's per-archetype label via the Svg accessibilityLabel so the mapping is observable via getByLabelText
- suggested fix: Create components/event/enemy-art/__tests__/EnemyIllustration.test.tsx covering the generic fall-through, each bespoke archetype's CreatureScene label, the tyrant boss-vs-non-boss branch, and the keyless-boss tyrant default, reading the LABELS/resolveEnemyArchetype truth at test time
- source: audit
- issue: #454
- addressed: 2026-06-18 via commit 72e1bdd
- fix: Added components/event/enemy-art/__tests__/EnemyIllustration.test.tsx (8 hermetic cases) pinning the dispatcher contract: the bespoke-sample/resolver alignment guard, the generic fall-through (unmatched key + no key -> EncounterIllustration's label), each of the eight bespoke archetypes rendering a non-generic image-role CreatureScene label, the distinct-per-archetype label set, the tyrant boss branch (crowned CreatureScene, no throne BossIllustration label) vs. the tyrant non-boss branch (throne BossIllustration), and the keyless-boss tyrant default. Labels + resolveEnemyArchetype truth read at test time so the suite survives roster/copy churn. Verify green (244 suites / 2576 tests, +8).

- observation: ThemeSwitcher (the bottom-of-character-tab COLOUR THEME switcher) is a logic-bearing interactive player-facing component with no colocated test; it gates the swatch grid behind a collapsed-by-default `expanded` toggle (chevron + accessibilityState + Collapse/Expand label), reads the active theme name into the header, renders one swatch per registered theme, highlights the active swatch (sulfur border width 2 + sulfur name vs ash border width 1 + parchment name) with a `selected` accessibility state and `, active` label suffix, and wires each swatch press to `setActiveTheme(id)` against the live runtime store — yet was never exercised by a test
- evidence: components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx (165 lines) exports ThemeSwitcher and renders testIDs theme-switcher, theme-switcher-toggle, theme-<id>; a grep for ThemeSwitcher across *.test.ts/*.test.tsx returned no matches; it is mounted on app/(tabs)/character/index.tsx; sibling interactive components (StanceRow, SatchelTray, TutorialCoach, WrathMeter) all carry colocated render tests
- suggested fix: Create components/__tests__/ThemeSwitcher.test.tsx covering the collapsed default (no grid, Expand chevron/label), the expand/collapse toggle, the active-name header readout, one swatch per registered theme, the active swatch's selected state + active label vs inactive, and a setActiveTheme press switching the live theme, reading theme registries at runtime and resetting in afterEach
- source: audit
- issue: #452
- addressed: 2026-06-18 via commit b243454
- fix: Added components/__tests__/ThemeSwitcher.test.tsx (8 hermetic cases) pinning the section mount/header, the collapsed-by-default gate (no swatch grid, Expand label + ▸ chevron, accessibilityState expanded:false), the active-name header readout, the initialExpanded path + accessibilityState expanded:true + ▾ chevron, the toggle-press expand/collapse cycle, one swatch per registered theme rendered, the active-vs-inactive swatch accessibility (selected state + ", active" label suffix), and a setActiveTheme press switching the live getActiveThemeId(). THEME_ORDER/THEME_SPECS read at runtime and the theme reset to DEFAULT_THEME_ID in afterEach so the suite survives theme-content churn. Verify green (243 suites / 2568 tests, +8).

- next: Add hermetic coverage for the EMPTY_VM gate (no-pending + non-village kind), resolveWareItem against real consumable/equipment ids and the unknown-id null, merchant line/hasDialogue derivation (with/without a tree, empty-text node), ware filtering of unknown ids, and the affordability threshold, following the existing presenter Pick<AppStoreState> fixture pattern
- observation: village.engine.ts (the Phase 137 dedicated settlement-screen presenter — selectVillageVM + the resolveWareItem ware resolver) is a pure, logic-bearing, player-facing presenter with no test coverage; it gates on EMPTY_VM for no-pending/non-village events, derives each merchant's stall-call line and hasDialogue from the dialogue-tree root node, resolves shop wares against the engine consumable/equipment libraries (hiding unknown ids), and flags affordability via currency >= price, yet was never exercised by a colocated or e2e test
- evidence: state/presenters/village.engine.ts (108 lines) exports selectVillageVM/resolveWareItem; a grep for selectVillageViewModel|VillageViewModel|VillageWareVM|village.engine across state/**/*.test.* returned no matches (village *data* is referenced by event-pools/map-encounter-minigames e2e, not the presenter's logic); sibling presenters aftermath/hazard/levelup/equipDelta/combat-hud all carry colocated *.engine.test.ts
- suggested fix: Create state/presenters/__tests__/village.engine.test.ts covering the EMPTY_VM gate, resolveWareItem (real consumable id, real equipment-template id, unknown-id null), merchant line/hasDialogue derivation, unknown-ware filtering, and the affordability threshold, following the presenter Pick<AppStoreState> fixture pattern
- source: audit

- next: Add hermetic unit coverage for each of the seven step `done(session, vm)` predicates at its exact boundary, the `currentTutorialStep` first-unmet scan (including out-of-order later-predicate satisfaction still returning the earliest unmet index), and the `-1` script-complete sentinel, using minimal partial-session fixtures that populate only the fields each predicate reads
- observation: tutorial-steps.ts owns the stateless step engine behind the guided first gleaning — seven `done` predicates that each gate on a single session boundary (phase leaving approach-select, first satchel item, first breath tended, first offering paid, a tool used, first descent, and the withdraw-phase set) plus `currentTutorialStep`, which returns the index of the FIRST unmet step or `-1` once all are satisfied; it is exercised only indirectly (TutorialCoach.test.tsx through the rendered counter, gathering.tutorial.engine through real store transitions) and has no colocated unit test pinning each predicate's threshold or the first-unmet/`-1` contract directly
- evidence: components/gathering/tutorial-steps.ts (113 lines) exports GATHERING_TUTORIAL_STEPS and currentTutorialStep but has no tutorial-steps.test.ts in components/gathering/ or its __tests__/ (siblings ApproachSelect, GatheringBoard, GatheringOverlays, PlotCard, SatchelTray, SpoilsOverlay, TutorialCoach, WrathMeter all carry colocated tests); state/e2e/gathering.tutorial.engine.test.ts imports currentTutorialStep but asserts only in-order advancement through the live store, never an isolated predicate boundary or out-of-order first-unmet case
- suggested fix: Create components/gathering/__tests__/tutorial-steps.test.ts covering each of the seven predicates flipping false→true at its threshold (e.g. satchel.length 0→1, breathsTended 0→1, depth 0→1, each withdraw phase member), currentTutorialStep returning the first unmet index when a later predicate is already satisfied out of order, and the `-1` return when every predicate is met, following the SatchelTray/TutorialCoach minimal partial-session fixture pattern
- source: audit
- issue: #448
- addressed: 2026-06-17 via commit 9fcd4fa

Minimal partial-session fixtures via a `freshSession(overrides)` builder populate only predicate-read fields; steps resolved by id so the suite survives a reorder.

- observation: TutorialCoach (the bottom-docked guided-first-gleaning coach) derives its current step statelessly from the live session each render (`currentTutorialStep` — first step whose `done` predicate is unmet), returns null once the script completes (`index < 0`), renders a `FIRST GLEANING · index+1 / length` counter, the current step's title/body/lookFor copy under a `key={step.id}` re-animation, and a SKIP control wired to `onSkip`, yet had no colocated render test — the predicate engine alone was covered by the gathering.tutorial.engine e2e (step ids only)
- evidence: components/gathering/TutorialCoach.tsx (99 lines) exports TutorialCoach and renders testIDs gathering-tutorial and gathering-tutorial-skip, but had no test in components/gathering/__tests__/ (siblings ApproachSelect, GatheringBoard, GatheringOverlays, PlotCard, SatchelTray, SpoilsOverlay, WrathMeter all carry one); GatheringIntroOverlay/glyphs are static presentation/SVG art
- suggested fix: Create components/gathering/__tests__/TutorialCoach.test.tsx covering the index<0 null return, the step counter at multiple steps, the current step's title/body/find rendering, the step-swap when an earlier predicate is met, and the SKIP press firing onSkip, following the SatchelTray render pattern
- source: audit
- issue: #447
- addressed: 2026-06-17 via commit cf17a0f
- fix: Added components/gathering/__tests__/TutorialCoach.test.tsx (7 hermetic cases) pinning the index<0 null-return gate (no banner when the script is complete), the banner render while a step is unmet, the FIRST GLEANING · n / total counter at steps 1 and 4, the current step's title/body/find copy, the step-swap when an earlier predicate is met (next title shown, prior hidden), and the SKIP press firing onSkip exactly once. Minimal partial-session fixtures populate only the fields the seven step predicates read. Verify green (238 suites / 2522 tests, +7).

- observation: EquipDeltaPanel (the Phase 133 equip-change delta surface inside the expanded ItemCard — eyebrow, signed stat chips, and gained/lost tag blocks) suppresses the whole panel on `delta.isEmpty`, maps `mode` to an ON EQUIP/UNEQUIP/SWAP eyebrow, gates each side on `hasAny`, formats modifiers as `name (value)` or falls back to `id`, renders named effects via TooltipTarget vs. anonymous ones as plain tags with on-hit/on-defend prefixes, and signs resource labels via `resourceLabel`, yet had no colocated test coverage
- evidence: components/inventory/EquipDeltaPanel.tsx (227 lines) shipped in commit 8a46160 (Phase 133) and renders testIDs equip-delta-<itemId>, equip-delta-stats/gained/lost, but no EquipDeltaPanel.test.tsx existed in components/inventory/ or its __tests__/ (it was exercised only indirectly via ItemCard.test.tsx); the larger glyphs.tsx/danger-art.tsx files are pure static SVG art
- suggested fix: Create components/inventory/EquipDeltaPanel.test.tsx covering isEmpty suppression, the three mode eyebrows, signed stat chips, the hasAny side gate, swap dual-side rendering, modifierText value-vs-bare, EffectTag named-tooltip-vs-anonymous with prefixes, and resourceLabel formatting, following the ItemCard render pattern
- source: audit
- issue: #444
- addressed: 2026-06-17 via commit c9d10a2
- fix: Added components/inventory/EquipDeltaPanel.test.tsx (10 hermetic cases) pinning the isEmpty whole-panel suppression, the equip/unequip/swap eyebrow mapping, signed +/- stat chips, the per-side hasAny gate (empty side renders nothing), swap dual-side rendering, modifierText (rolled-value `name (5)` vs. bare-id fallback), EffectTag (named via TooltipTarget tip vs. anonymous plain tag) with on-hit/on-defend prefixing, and resourceLabel signed formatting.

- observation: StanceRow (the per-stance ± allocation row inside the level-up modal — emblem, "newValue from current" counter, +N delta, and increment/decrement controls) derives `newValue = current + spent`, a `showDelta = spent > 0` gate that swaps the +N delta label for a waiting bar, gated press handlers (`onPress={canInc ? onInc : undefined}` / `canDec ? onDec : undefined`), disabled-state border/glyph colours and `accessibilityState={{ disabled }}`, and per-stance testIDs/accessibility labels, yet had no colocated test coverage
- evidence: components/levelup/StanceRow.tsx (160 lines) exports StanceRow and renders testID levelup-modal-row-<stance> with levelup-modal-inc/dec-<stance> controls, but was the only file in components/levelup/ absent from components/levelup/__tests__/ (siblings AscendStrip, DerivedPreviewRibbon, LearnSkillModal, LevelReadyStrip, LevelUpModal all carry colocated tests)
- suggested fix: Create components/levelup/__tests__/StanceRow.test.tsx covering the newValue counter, the showDelta vs waiting-bar branch, the inc/dec press gating (fires when enabled, no-op when disabled), the disabled accessibilityState, and the per-stance testIDs/labels, following the DerivedPreviewRibbon render pattern
- source: audit
- issue: #443
- addressed: 2026-06-17 via commit 5cd8c21
- fix: Added components/levelup/__tests__/StanceRow.test.tsx (13 hermetic cases) pinning the per-stance testIDs/labels (heart/body/mind row + inc/dec controls, uppercased label), the newValue = current + spent projection ("from current" subline), the showDelta = spent > 0 gate (delta label hidden at spent 0, "+N" shown otherwise), the inc/dec press gating (onInc/onDec fire exactly once when enabled, no-op when disabled), and the canInc/canDec disabled accessibilityState on both controls.

- observation: useQuestLanding (the presentation-only choreography that replays a resolved bone-die cast as tumble → walk the piece one space at a time → reveal the landing card) derives a tumbling `dieFace` cycled deterministically from `rollTick` (`(rollTick % 6) + 1`), a modular-wrap walk route (`steps = (to - from + length) % length`, `pathPositions` listing each step in order), a `still → rolling → walking → arrived` stage machine, a `targetPos`/`pathPositions` "where you're headed" preview, a `revealed` gate that opens the card only after the arrive beat, an `arrivalKey` flourish bump, and a VM-sync reset whenever the phase leaves `space` — all on flushable setTimeout/setInterval timers, yet had no colocated test coverage
- evidence: components/quest/useQuestLanding.ts (170 lines) exports useQuestLanding(vm) and QUEST_LANDING_TIMING; its file header (line 16) states "All timers are plain setTimeout/setInterval so tests can flush them deterministically," but the only test reference (state/e2e/quest.screen.test.tsx:17) imports QUEST_LANDING_TIMING alone — the hook's derivation logic was absent from any __tests__/ dir
- suggested fix: Create components/quest/__tests__/useQuestLanding.test.ts using renderHook + jest fake timers covering the tumble face cycle, the walk path/step computation (including modular wrap), the stage transitions, the steps===0 short-circuit, the targetPos/pathPositions preview, the revealed timing gate, the arrivalKey bump, and the phase-leaves-space reset, following the combat-mode.engine renderHook pattern
- source: audit
- issue: #441
- addressed: 2026-06-17 via commit 0254973
- fix: Added components/quest/__tests__/useQuestLanding.test.ts (11 hermetic cases, jest fake timers) pinning the idle VM-sync + lastRoll seed, the deterministic tumbling die-face cycle (rollTick % 6 + 1 including the wrap back to 1), the settle-to-real-face + route preview once tumbling ends, the modular-wrap walk path/step computation (including lapping the slipway: from=6 to=1 -> route 7,0,1), the still->rolling->walking->arrived stage machine, the steps===0 no-movement short-circuit (rolling straight to arrived), the revealed timing gate (card opens only after the arrive beat), the arrivalKey flourish bump (exactly once per landing), and the phase-leaves-space reset/re-sync to the VM.

- next: Add hermetic coverage for the per-family progress clamp, empty/set/at-risk derivation, SET-badge-vs-progress-text branch, the empty-vs-at-risk header copy, and the composed accessibility label, following the SpoilsOverlay/WrathMeter render pattern
- observation: SatchelTray (the four family stacks under the gathering site showing set-progress — everything in it is "at risk" until the player withdraws) derives a per-stack `progress = Math.min(1, vm.richness / vm.setThreshold)` clamp, an `empty = vm.pieces === 0` dim, a `vm.set` border/badge swap, a conditional SET-badge vs `richness/threshold` progress-text, an empty-vs-at-risk header subline, and a composed per-family accessibility label, yet had no colocated test coverage
- evidence: components/gathering/SatchelTray.tsx (104 lines) renders testID gathering-satchel with the THE SATCHEL header, four FamilyStack children carrying accessibilityLabel "<label>: <pieces> pieces, richness <richness> of <setThreshold>[, set complete]", but was absent from components/gathering/__tests__/
- suggested fix: Create components/gathering/__tests__/SatchelTray.test.tsx covering the progress clamp at/over threshold, the empty dim, the SET-badge vs progress-text branch, the empty-vs-at-risk header copy, and the per-family accessibility label, following the SpoilsOverlay/WrathMeter render pattern
- source: audit
- issue: #440
- addressed: 2026-06-17 via commit cdbaa53
- fix: Added components/gathering/__tests__/SatchelTray.test.tsx (9 hermetic cases) pinning the THE SATCHEL header mount, the empty-and-safe vs at-risk header subline, every family label + piece count (including the two zero-piece stacks), the SET badge for a completed family, the richness/threshold progress-text for unset families (single + duplicate 0/5 stacks), and the three accessibility-label branches (set-complete suffix / in-progress / empty).

- next: Add hermetic coverage for the pure segmentColor helper plus the status-tag derivation, notch fired/unfired, grace colouring, and dynamic segment-count render branches
- observation: WrathMeter (the segmented WRATH bar under the gathering site's opening eye — shows the place's escalating answer as the meter fills, with threshold notches and surcharge status tags) contains a pure `segmentColor(index, vm, AXM)` helper that picks one of three fills by how many thresholds the index has passed, plus conditional sickled/mired/watcher/dusk tag rows, per-threshold fired-vs-unfired notch tinting, grace-active colouring, eye-open ratio colouring, and a `vm.max`-driven dynamic segment count, yet had no colocated test coverage
- evidence: components/gathering/WrathMeter.tsx (130 lines) renders testID gathering-wrath with the WRATH value/max label, an accessibilityLabel reporting value/dusk, threshold notches, and the four status tags (sickled/mired/watcher/dusk), but was absent from components/gathering/__tests__/
