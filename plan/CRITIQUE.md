## Done

### [LOW] /state/presenters/navigation.engine.ts — TODO comments break voice consistency ✅
- pass: 1 (commit 2a2b0b6)
- viewport: repository
- category: voice
- observation: Multiple TODO comments break the terse archaic voice with modern development language
- evidence: navigation.engine.ts lines contain 'TODO: When engine exposes' which conflicts with the ritual/archaic voice guideline
- suggested fix: Rewrite TODOs in archaic voice or use different comment style
- source: reader
- issue: #23
- **Resolved 2026-05-15.** Rewrote both `TODO`-prefixed comments in `state/presenters/navigation.engine.ts` to match the codebase's "Until / Once X ships…" pattern already used in `components/EventGate.tsx` and `state/presenters/character.engine.ts`. No behaviour change — `selectTabBadges` still returns `EMPTY_BADGES`. Closes #23.

### [MED] /app/_layout.tsx — deep link implementation status unclear ✅
- pass: 1 (commit 2a2b0b6)
- viewport: repository
- category: comprehension
- observation: Deep linking handlers are stubbed with TODO comments indicating incomplete implementation
- evidence: app/_layout.tsx lines 72-82: handleDeepLink function has logic but comments suggest incomplete functionality
- suggested fix: Complete deep link implementation or document current limitations
- source: reader
- issue: #21
- **Resolved 2026-05-15.** Removed the dead `handleDeepLink` `useEffect` block from `app/_layout.tsx` (both branches were no-ops); replaced with a comment block documenting that deep linking is declared in `app.json` but not yet wired to navigation, plus the implementation notes needed when it gets wired. Also dropped the now-unused `expo-linking` import. Closes #21.

### [MED] /package.json — deploy environment setup unclear ✅
- pass: 1 (commit 2a2b0b6)
- viewport: repository
- category: comprehension
- observation: Deploy commands exist but appear to require manual environment setup not documented for new maintainers
- evidence: package.json lines 21-22: deploy commands reference scripts/with-env.mjs and eas build but env setup is unclear
- suggested fix: Add quick start section for deploy environment setup
- source: reader
- issue: #20
- **Resolved 2026-05-15.** Added a "Deploy environment" section to README.md covering `.env.example` setup, the EXPO_TOKEN / EAS_PROJECT_ID / DEPLOY_PROVIDER table, build commands, and the `deploy:check` stub contract. Closes #20.

### [HIGH] /README.md — broken TODO.md reference ✅
- pass: 1 (commit 2a2b0b6)
- viewport: repository
- category: comprehension
- observation: README references missing TODO.md file that would contain native testing plan
- evidence: README.md line 192: 'See [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md) for the eventual native plan.'
- suggested fix: Either create TODO.md or remove the broken reference
- source: reader
- **Resolved 2026-05-15.** Removed broken reference to non-existent TODO.md file from README. Simplified text to state that native testing is not wired in current pass. See commit 7b5b44d.
