# Phase 32 — UI refresh from Claude Design handoff (rolling port)

> **Status: [ ] — rolling phase, no fixed tick count.** Filed
> via `/plan-a-phase` 2026-05-16 with topic "Update the UI with
> the new designs from Claude design." Mirrors the
> Phase 17 → Phase 28 pattern that shipped Token Crucible from
> this same design source.

## Outcome

The user ports new visual designs from the upstream Claude
Design board into the mobile app. The autonomous loop wraps
each port with the project's hermetic-test contracts so the
new UI surfaces are reachable from the existing presenter /
view-model / smoke-render harness machinery.

**Design source:** Claude Design at
<https://claude.ai/design/p/019e0f5a-a0f0-753b-be1e-8939e6011384>
(authenticated; the loop cannot fetch the contents directly —
the user is the source of truth for what each port contains).

This is a **rolling phase**: each ported surface is its own
sub-tick (`Phase 32 Tick A`, `Phase 32 Tick B`, …). The phase
stays `[ ]` until the user has finished porting and every
sub-tick has its hermetic-test follow-up. No upper bound on
sub-ticks; the phase closes when the user signals "done with
the design pass" via `/oversight` and the build plan flips it
to `[x]`.

## Sub-tick decomposition

Each sub-tick splits in two commits, mirroring the
Phase 17 / Phase 28 pattern that's already shipped end-to-end:

1. **User commit**: `feat: <surface> — port from design handoff`.
   The user authors the port — new screen, modified existing
   screen, new component, whatever the design specifies.
   Anything goes; the loop reads the diff afterwards.
2. **Loop commit**: `feat(spec32 tick <X>): <surface> presenter
   + hermetic tests`. The next `/march` tick:
   - Reads the user's port diff.
   - Extracts any in-component logic into a colocated
     presenter (`<surface>.engine.ts`) per the locked
     presenter contract.
   - Adds hermetic e2e tests alongside the new code.
   - Ensures the surface appears in
     `state/e2e/smoke-render.engine.test.tsx`'s coverage if
     it's a new top-level screen / modal.
   - Routes any new ritual / accessibility copy through the
     presenter so the view layer carries no inline literals
     (Hard Rule #8).
   - Pins the new theme tokens (if any) in `theme/axm.ts`
     rather than letting hex literals leak into components.

## Routes / API endpoints / CLI surface — locked

No new routes or API contracts unless the design explicitly
adds a screen. New screens follow the existing expo-router
file-based routing convention (`app/<surface>/index.tsx` or
`app/<surface>.tsx`). If the design proposes a route change to
an existing screen, that's a separate explicit decision the
user surfaces via `/oversight`; this phase does not silently
re-route.

## Content / data reads — engine surface

Every read remains through the existing engine surface. The
design refresh is presentation-only: this phase **does not**
add new engine consumers. If a port needs an engine surface
the engine doesn't yet expose, that's a separate phase
(file via `/expand` or `/oversight` and gate Tick X on it).

## Components / handlers — modified per sub-tick

Surfaces commonly touched (non-exhaustive — the design board
is the source of truth):

- `app/(tabs)/exploration/index.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/combat.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/character/index.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/inventory/index.tsx`
- `app/event/index.tsx`
- `app/crucible.tsx`
- `components/<atom>.tsx` for shared visual primitives
- `theme/axm.ts` for new tokens

Each sub-tick names which files it touched in the commit body.

## Cross-links

**In (verify before starting each sub-tick):**

- `pnpm verify` green at baseline (410/410 after Phase 31).
- The user's port commit landed and pushed.
- The smoke-render harness (`state/e2e/smoke-render.engine.test.tsx`,
  Phase 30 Tick A) is the canonical "screen mounts cleanly"
  contract; it surfaces the same identity-churn / blank-render
  / template-leak failure shapes that motivated its creation.

**Out (ships across sub-ticks):**

- `<surface>.engine.ts` — new or extended presenter per port.
- `state/e2e/<surface>.engine.test.ts` — new hermetic tests.
- `state/e2e/smoke-render.engine.test.tsx` — extended cases
  when new screens land.
- `theme/axm.ts` — new tokens when the design uses colors not
  already in `AXM.{bg, parchment, blood, sulfur, rust, bone,
  ash}`.

## Decisions made upfront — DO NOT ASK

1. **The user drives the port; the loop follows.** Claude
   Design is authenticated, so the loop cannot read the design
   contents directly (HTTP 403 from WebFetch). User authors
   each `feat: <surface> — port from design handoff` commit;
   `/march` does the testing + extraction afterwards. This is
   the Phase 17 / Phase 28 precedent applied as a standing
   pattern.
2. **Voice register survives the design refresh.** Even if
   the design shows new copy strings, the bearings voice rule
   stands: terse, archaic, ritual, **no second-person archaic
   pronouns** (thee / thou / thy / thine / ye). If the design
   board uses banned pronouns, the loop swaps them for
   register-equivalent alternatives during the test-and-extract
   tick. Set via `/oversight` 2026-05-15; bearings line 180-184.
3. **Hard Rule #8 (content stays in the proper layer) survives
   the design refresh.** Any visible ritual copy lands in the
   presenter (`vm.<field>`), not as a literal in the screen
   tree. The smoke-render harness's `expectNoTemplateLeaks` +
   `expectNonEmptyBody` contracts catch regressions; the
   per-screen tests pin the specific strings.
4. **Theme tokens win over hex literals.** If the design uses
   a color outside the existing palette, the loop's
   test-and-extract tick adds a token to `theme/axm.ts`
   (e.g. `AXM.<new-token>`) and updates the port to consume
   the token. The user's port commit may temporarily use hex
   literals; the loop normalizes them on the follow-up.
5. **No engine API additions in this phase.** The refresh is
   presentation-only. If a port needs a new engine surface,
   the loop halts the sub-tick and files a candidate via
   `/expand` or surfaces via `/oversight`; it does not
   patch the engine package locally.
6. **No `design/` folder is created speculatively.** Bearings
   line 152-158 notes the project doesn't use a `design/`
   export folder today. If the user wants one (e.g. to drop
   screenshots, decision logs, or exported style guides
   adjacent to the code), that's a separate decision; this
   phase doesn't create it.
7. **Smoke-render coverage is mandatory for any new screen.**
   If a sub-tick adds a new top-level screen / modal, it
   appears in `state/e2e/smoke-render.engine.test.tsx`'s
   `describe('smoke-render: each primary surface')` block
   before the sub-tick can commit. This is the same gate
   Phase 30 Tick A locked in for the existing five surfaces.
8. **One surface per sub-tick.** Each sub-tick covers exactly
   one design surface. Bundling multiple screens into a single
   commit makes the loop's test-and-extract tick harder to
   keep verify-green incrementally.

## Pages × tests matrix

Per sub-tick:

| Surface (per Tick) | Test file | Cases (delta per sub-tick) |
|---|---|---|
| The ported surface | `state/e2e/<surface>.engine.test.ts` (new or extended) | +2-5 per sub-tick: shape contract; behavioural fixture; empty / loading / error state |
| The ported surface (render) | `state/e2e/smoke-render.engine.test.tsx` | +0 if existing screen; +2-3 if new screen (no-throw, no-template-leak, non-empty body) |

Verify target: +2-8 hermetic tests per sub-tick. No upper bound
on phase total; current baseline is 410.

## Verify gate

```bash
pnpm verify
```

Baseline 410/410 (post-`fb53af0`). Each sub-tick lands +verify
delta as documented in its commit body. Phase closes (`[x]`) when
the user signals "done porting" via `/oversight` and the loop
has no outstanding sub-ticks; the final tick may include a
broader audit pass to confirm the smoke-render harness covers
every new surface end-to-end.

## Deploy gate

Stub (manual EAS). Each sub-tick logs the same "no builds found
for commit X" deploy-check output; on-device verification waits
for the next manual `npm run deploy:preview` after a meaningful
batch of sub-ticks lands. The hermetic harness substitutes for
deploy-time verification during the rolling port.

## Commit body templates

**User commit (per port):**

```
feat: <surface> — port from design handoff

Ports the <surface> design from Claude Design at
<https://claude.ai/design/p/019e0f5a-a0f0-753b-be1e-8939e6011384>.

- <files touched>
- <key visual / behavioural changes>

Phase 32 sub-tick — `/march` will follow up with presenter
extraction + hermetic tests in the next loop tick.
```

**Loop follow-up commit (per sub-tick):**

```
feat(spec32 tick <X>): <surface> presenter + hermetic tests

Phase 32 sub-tick <X> — wraps the user's <surface> port
(commit `<port-sha>`) with the project's test contracts.

- state/presenters/<surface>.engine.ts (extracted / extended):
  <pure mapper changes>.
- state/e2e/<surface>.engine.test.ts (new / extended):
  +<N> hermetic cases pinning <contract>.
- state/e2e/smoke-render.engine.test.tsx: <added a new
  surface block | no-op — screen already covered>.
- <any theme/axm.ts additions for new tokens>

Decisions per the brief:
- <any non-obvious calls the test-and-extract made>.

Verify: <new>/<new> (was <old>; +<delta>).
```

## DoD

Phase 32 closes (`[x]`) when **all** of:

1. The user has signaled "design refresh complete" via
   `/oversight` (no implicit close; the rolling phase needs an
   explicit user end-of-pass).
2. Every user port commit has its paired loop follow-up commit
   (presenter + hermetic tests + smoke-render coverage).
3. `pnpm verify` is green at the closing commit.
4. The smoke-render harness covers every primary surface
   touched by the refresh.

## Follow-ups (out of scope this phase)

- **Asset swap pipeline.** If the design replaces the coded
  SVG placeholders with real artwork, the
  `.cursor/skills/swap-asset-placeholder/SKILL.md` flow handles
  that — separate from this phase.
- **New engine surfaces.** Any port that needs an engine field
  the engine doesn't expose halts that sub-tick and files via
  `/expand`. The engine-team handoff doc
  (`docs/engine-team-handoff-2026-05-16.md`) already lists the
  current engine asks; new ones append there.
- **`design/` folder convention.** Adopting the
  `nexus/customization/visual-system.md` `design/` export
  pattern is a separate decision the user makes when ready;
  not gated on this phase.
