# Phase 98 — Combat terminology implementation

## Outcome

Implement the terminology and iconography improvements designed in Phase 96 across the combat UI. Replace engine jargon with player-friendly language, update confusing icons, and improve information hierarchy. Addresses AUDIT [4.5] Combat UX unintuitive and closes playtest findings [F02]/[F04]/[F05]/[F06].

## Why

Phase 96 produced the design specification for fixing combat UX comprehension barriers. This phase implements those designs, transforming the combat interface from "decode the interface" to "understand the tactical situation" through player-centric terminology and clearer visual hierarchy.

## Surface / Routes

**No route changes.** Updates existing combat screen at `app/(tabs)/combat.tsx` and combat components.

## Content / data reads

| Helper | Call | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `selectCombatViewModel` | `selectCombatViewModel(state)` | Get current combat state and format with new terminology |
| Existing combat selectors | N/A | Updated to return player-friendly labels |

## Components / handlers

**Updated existing components:**
- `app/(tabs)/combat.tsx` — main combat screen with new terminology
- `components/combat/CombatPanel.tsx` — updated labels and phase descriptions
- `components/combat/PhaseBottom.tsx` — action buttons with clear language
- `components/ActionIcon.tsx` — improved icon comprehension
- `components/EffectChip.tsx` — player-friendly effect names
- `components/EffectGlyph.tsx` — clearer visual symbols
- `components/StanceGlyph.tsx` — intuitive stance indicators

**Reused primitives:**
- Theme tokens from `theme/axm.ts` (unchanged)
- Existing layout components
- Current combat flow and mechanics

## Cross-links

**In (verify):** Combat remains accessible from main tab navigation.
**Out (ship):** No new outbound links added.
**Retro-fit:** None required — combat is a standalone screen.

## SEO / metadata

**Not applicable** — mobile app with no web URLs.

## Hero / body / sub-section composition

**Combat screen layout (unchanged structure, updated content):**
- Header: "COMBAT" remains, but phase labels use player-friendly terms
- Body: Combat panel with clearer terminology and iconography  
- Footer: Action buttons with intuitive language ("COMMIT" vs "LET IT FALL")

**Key terminology updates:**
- "Choose Your Guard" (was `choosingStance`)
- "Your Move" (was `choosingAction`) 
- "Select Technique" (was `choosingSkill`)
- "Strike Unfolds" (was `resolving`)
- "TECHNIQUES" header (was "CRUCIBLE")
- "HEALTH" label (was "VITAE")
- "FOCUS" indicator (was "MIND MARKS")

## Empty / loading / error states

**Preserved existing states with updated terminology:**
- No combat active: "No battle in progress"
- Loading combat: "Preparing for battle..."
- Error state: "Battle interrupted - restart to continue"

## Decisions made upfront — DO NOT ASK

1. **Terminology source:** Use exact mappings from `design/combat-ux-overhaul.md` terminology table. No improvisation on language.

2. **Implementation scope:** Focus only on terminology and iconography as specified in Phase 96 design. No functional changes to combat mechanics.

3. **Presenter layer:** Update presenter to return player-friendly labels while maintaining existing data structure and contract.

4. **Icon improvements:** Enhance visual clarity of existing icons without wholesale redesign. Maintain current icon structure.

5. **Battle log language:** Implement player-friendly battle log format from design brief, replacing engine terminology with natural language.

6. **Progressive implementation:** Ship all terminology changes in single phase to maintain consistency. Avoid partial updates.

7. **Accessibility preservation:** Ensure all terminology changes improve comprehension for new players while maintaining information density for experienced players.

## Mobile reflow / responsive / paginate / output limits

**No changes to responsive behavior.** Existing combat layout works across device sizes. Updated terminology uses similar character counts to maintain visual balance.
