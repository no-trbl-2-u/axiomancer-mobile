/**
 * Hazard minigame — centralised balance tuning.
 *
 * Every numeric knob the hazard-tuning skill is allowed to move lives
 * here, in one object, so balance passes never have to hunt through the
 * engine, content, or components. Nothing in this file decides rules —
 * it only supplies the magnitudes that the rules and authored content
 * read.
 *
 * Grouped by what they affect:
 *  - `round`    — the shape of a round (dice, hand, momentum).
 *  - `deck`     — draw-bag sizing (the starter deck size multiplier).
 *  - `dice`     — the die-face bag, i.e. colour spread + hex (✕) odds.
 *  - `cards`    — per-colour number bands + utility base/powered amounts.
 *  - `rewards`  — reward / consequence payouts and reward-rarity odds.
 *  - `hand`     — the fanned-hand arch geometry.
 *
 * The authored hazard thresholds stay in `content.ts` (they are
 * per-hazard, not global), but they are the other half of the
 * difficulty dial and are guarded by `__tests__/balance.sim.test.ts`.
